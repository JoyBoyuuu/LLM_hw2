1,"Some teachers draw pictures on the whiteboard to explain new concepts to students. But one chemistry lecturer draws on her own skin, due to an unusual medical condition. Dr Zoe Waller, 31, who teaches pharmacy at the University of East Anglia, suffers from the skin condition dermatographia. This is a type of urticaria, or hives - where a raised, itchy rash appears on the skin at the slightest pressure. It is thought to be caused when the cells under the surface of the skin release histamines as part of an allergic reaction, causing the skin to swell. Dr Zoe Waller, 31, is a university lecturer and uses her own skin to teach her students about new drugs and molecules, as she suffers from the skin condition dermatographia . Whenever Dr Waller draws on the skin, her condition means raised red  weals appear and she can create designs. She uploads them to social media and they are making waves across the university . However instead of hiding away her condition, Dr Waller is using it as a teaching aid. Her students are required to learn 100 drugs for their course and each day, she will draw a new one on her skin. Word of the unusual teaching method has spread across the university as well as social media where Dr Waller uploads her quirky designs. She said: 'I was only diagnosed with this two years ago and it's a pretty cool condition to have. 'Some people look at my arm and think I've been self-harming but it doesn't hurt at all. 'I use a blunt pencil or cocktail stick to create the detail needed for the composition of the drugs.' Dermographism or 'skin writing' is a type of urticaria, or hives - where a raised, itchy rash appears on the skin. Dermatographia is thought to be caused when the cells under the surface of the skin release histamines under the slightest pressure. Histamines are chemicals released in the body as part of an allergic reaction, causing the skin to swell. In this type of urticaria, itchy weals occur after friction such as rubbing or stroking the skin. This itching may be aggravated by heat. Weals and red marks also often appear as lines at the sites of scratching, and generally last for less than one hour.' Antihistamines block the effect of histamine, and reduce itching and the rash in most people, but may not relieve urticaria completely. If urticaria occurs frequently, it is best to take antihistamines regularly every day. The lecturer discovered her unusual skin condition after she started working at the University's school of pharmacy. She noticed her skin was itchy and irritated but the doctor couldn't remember the name of the condition he thought she had and sent her away with anti-histamines. She said: 'I was left confused after visiting the doctor. Then my friend in America sent me a link to Ariana Russell's work and I knew then that was what I had.' Ariana Russell is an artist in the USA who uses her own body and dermatographia to create artwork. Inspired by Ariana, Dr Waller set to work on her own project - creating science molecules and compounds for her students using her skin. Her students and fellow professors often ask her for requests which she happily draws on her skin. Dr Waller said: 'My skin might not be like this forever but it's a fun and unusual way of teaching my students and it grabs their attention a lot more than a text book would.' Dr Tabi Leslie, from the British Association of Dermatologists, explained that dermographism or 'skin writing' is a type of urticaria. She said: 'Raised red weals, which are caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells, appear at sights of friction, such as rubbing or stroking of the skin. 'This itching may also be aggravated by heat. 'Weals and red marks often appear as lines at the sites of scratching, and generally last for less than one hour. 'Antihistamines are used to reduce the itch and the rash, and are effective in most patients. People across the university have began to make requests for designs they want Dr Waller to draw on herself . 'However, antihistamines may not relieve the symptoms completely in all cases. 'In such cases, other treatments may need to be used in addition, or higher dosages of antihistamines may be prescribed than licensed recommendations suggest. 'Sufferers of dermographism may need to take antihistamines on a daily basis, as long as the symptoms persists. Usually, the non-sedating antihistamines are preferred as they have fewer side effects. 'Treatment needs to continue until the condition settles by itself which may take years. 'Your doctor will advise you on the best regime depending on the severity of your symptoms.'

2,"There was a time when the name of Juventus would be one to avoid in the semi-final of European competition. Those days are long gone. When The Old Lady of Turin takes her place alongside Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid on Friday, it will appear that Massimiliano Allegri has returned this great club to the elite level. In reality it will be a clash of cultures as Juventus, who have kept nine clean sheets in their last ten fixtures, plot their path to the Champions League final in Berlin. It will be painful and far from pretty if Juve, who held on to the lead Arturo Vidal gave them from the penalty spot in the first leg against Monaco, progress to the final on June 6. There were scenes of elation as a scoreless draw saw Juventus through to their first Champions League semi-final since 2003 .

Subs not used: Storari, Ogbonna,  Padoin, Sturaro, Matri. Booked: Chiellini, Tevez. Manager: Massimiliano Allegri 6. Referee: William Collum (Scotland) 7. At the final whistle Giorgio Chiellini raced across the athletics track at Stade Louis II to throw his number three shirt into the hordes of Juve supporters celebrating their first appearance in a semi-final since 2003. The feeling is that Juve’s race is run. On the surface Allegri’s team are looking good, 15 points clear of second placed Lazio in Serie A and heading for a semi-final against a genuine European force in a couple of weeks’ time. The reality is that this team is relying on some classic Italian traits, with some stubborn defending and the dogged work of Carlos Tevez, Juve’s only out ball, for some hustling up front. It works, painfully so at times, and they are certainly a long way short of the last Juventus team to reach the Champions League final at Old Trafford in 12 year ago. Back then Marcello Lippi’s team had some real class, with the names of Edgar Davids, David Trezeguet, Alessio Tacchinardi and Alessandro del Piero taking Milan to a penalty shoot-out in Manchester. Today’s team relies on the presence of their veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, a survivor from that defeated 2003 team, to provide some reassurance. Before this tie against Monaco, the Italian World Cup winning goalkeeper spoke about the honour and prestige for Juventus if they could reach the semi-final. The second leg was all about survival. At times this was about the darker side of the game, with Chiellini shown an early yellow card when he scandalously scooped the ball away with his hand to prevent Joao Moutinho racing clear. All three at the back - Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli - lived dangerously, a mistake waiting to happen on a tense and anxious night. Monaco were brisk and innovative, using the first half energy of their central midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia to provide the momentum for Leonardo Jardim’a side. Kondogbia deserved so much more from this tie. Juventus and Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini (left) reaches out to pull the ball away from Monaco's Joao Moutinho after slipping over .

Former Manchester City and West Ham marksman Tevez puts his hands to his mouth as a well-hit strike sails off target . He had a decent shout for a penalty in the first half when he was sandwiched between Chiellini and Vidal, sent off balance when the pair squashed him as he made his way into the area. Kondogbia was awesome here and anyone who can outshine Pirlo, save for the odd killer pass for Tevez or Alvaro Morata, in the centre of midfield must be doing something right. Tevez and Morata, who was eventually replaced in the 69th minute by Fernando Llorente, should be credited for their tireless performance in this second leg because they had both picked up a virus the night before the game. Both are believed to have been sick on the pitch. It was Tevez who had Juve’s best chance here, an effort that skidding wide of Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic’s left hand post on the stroke of half-time. Monaco sent for Dimitar Berbatov at the break, sending on the Bulgarian striker to replace the withdrawn figure of France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan. He had a poor game here.

Switzerland defender Lichtsteiner knows how key Croatian Subasic's speed off the line was as he comes close to an opening goal for Juve . There was a touch of the old Berbatov in this 45 minute spell, increasing the tempo with some quick-witted first team passes and some blindside runs into the Juve penalty area. What he craved was the one chance to beat Buffon, to carve out an opening that could, at the very least, have given them another 30 minutes to get the job done.

They needed it, the one chance to beat Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon to give them a chance of reaching the semi-final of the Champions League. Buffon was a key player here. He made a couple of decent stops, but his commanding presence and his reassuring nature in that Juve goal is a formidable hurdle for the opposition. Here, he simply could not be beaten.

3,"A mother has filmed the moment her five-year-year girl decided to give her a telling-off about the 'mess' in their house and her brother's bad behaviour. Saige, five, who's from the US, concludes the passionate rant by declaring she will move out and stay with her mum's best friend: 'I'm moving on, I'm going to Jenn's!' Unfortunately for her, her mother refuses to take the threat seriously and just laughs at her daughter, responding: 'No you're not.' Scroll down for video . 'I'm MOVING!' says five-year-old Saige, who has had enough of living with her mother for five years . In the video titled, 'Saige is mad and she's moving on', the determined little girl, gives her mother a stern nod and replies: 'Yes I am!' When her mother - who hasn't revealed her name but posts videos under YouTube channel Fourth St. James - asks her why she has to move out, Saige says she's been in the house 'way too long... for, like, five years'. She tells her mother what's behind her bad mood, explaining: 'I need to move on sometimes'. Saige then adds: 'I will make Jenn's house as clean as I can make it. Her mother replies: 'Why can't you make my house clean?' 'Because I don't love you,' says Saige, 'This is way dirty, it has no space. My room is a disaster, it has no room and I can barely have room to put my stuff.'

4,"How we work out the distance of something we can hear but not see has been somewhat of a mystery - until now. Scientists say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces. In a study they found that the reverberations of sound help us locate the distance of, for example, a car passing round a bend or a person nearby. Scientists at the University of Connecticut say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces (stock image shown). In a study they found that the reverberation of sound helps us locate the distance of, for example, a car passing round a bend or a person nearby . The research was conducted by scientists from the University of Connecticut and published in the Journal of Neuroscience. They said that echoes and fluctuations in volume are the cues we use to figure out the distance between us and the source of a noise. Researchers have long understood how we can tell a sound's direction - whether it's to our left or right, front or back, and above or below us. From their heavy build and short limbs, to the shape of their skull and teeth, there are many ways that the anatomy of Neanderthals differed to our own. Now experts say that even a small bone in their ears are dissimilar to one in modern humans, raising the prospect that our extinct ancient relatives heard differently to us too. Researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a Neanderthal child, whose remains were discovered in France 40 years ago. The remains from the two-year-old child, which are known as La Ferrassie 8, were discovered at La Ferrassie in the Dordogne, south western France, between 1970 and 1973. Asier Gómez-Olivencia, an Ikerbasque researcher at the University of the Basque Country in northern Spain, produced a 3D computer reconstruction of the remains. His work, published in The Journal of Human Evolution, reveals another anatomical difference between the Neanderthals and modern humans in the smallest ossicles of the body. But how we tell how far away it is had remained a mystery. 'The third dimension of sound location was pretty much unknown,' said Dr Duck Kim, a neuroscientist at UConn Health. The researchers suspected that the effect echoes had on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound's distance from us. To explore the idea, they used tiny microphones to record the sounds inside rabbits' ears as they played sounds at different locations. They used these recordings to simulate modulated or unmodulated noise coming from different distances from the rabbit. Then the researchers played the simulated sounds back to the rabbit, and measured the responses of neurons in the rabbit's inferior colliculus (IC), a region of the midbrain known to be important for sound perception. When the rabbit heard the simulated sounds, certain types of IC neurons fired more when the sound was closer - when there was a bigger difference between the sound's maximum and minimum volume. The farther away the source of a sound is from a listener, meanwhile, the more echoes there are, and the more limited the changes in volume become. As the source moved further away, therefore, the neurons fired less and less. The researchers say that the effect echoes have on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound's distance from us. Without amplitude modulation, for example in an anechoic (echo-free) room, pictured, a person can't tell how far away a noise is from them . The results suggest that, as a sound gets further away, our brains are able to work out the differences in its maximum and minimum volume - and thus its distance. Dr Pavel Zahorik, a researcher at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, got the same results with human volunteers. Without amplitude modulation, for example in an anechoic (echo-free) room, a person can't tell how far away that noise is. 'Reverberation is usually considered a bad thing,' detrimental to hearing clearly, said Dr Shigeyuki Kuwada, co-author on the University of Connecticut study. 'But it is necessary and beneficial in order to recognise distance.' The researchers hope to investigate the problem further, and  tie together the perception of distance, horizontal and vertical directions of sound.","University of Connecticut study reveals how we can measure distances .

5,"Melissa Wilson and her team-mates are on the brink of making history. On Saturday, at the 161st Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race, the women’s crews will battle the same Thames course as the men, who will follow an hour later. After decades of campaigning and 88 years since the first women to race were jeered by male spectators, they get equal billing. And for Wilson’s grandfather, 85-year-old Richard Cowell, from East Kilbride, it will be a momentous day. He is not up to the journey to watch his granddaughter compete for Cambridge but will still see the race, which will be televised for the first time. Wilson, 21, said: ‘I remember when I was 14 watching with my dad and my brother and saying “Are there going to be women on?” They laughed — not in a malicious way — and said: “There aren’t any women, you could cox I guess”. So the fact that 10 years on there is a women’s race on the Tideway and I’m in it is pretty remarkable. It’s so wonderful that my grandfather will be able to watch it, too.’ Melissa Wilson (left) and Caroline Reid of Cambridge Women's boat crew at Thames Rowing Club in London . Clare Balding gave up her regular stint on Channel 4’s Grand National coverage to present the event because she wants to send a message about the importance of women’s sport. ‘It was a big decision to make,’ said Balding. ‘But there will never be another first women’s Boat Race on the Tideway.’ Her statement was welcomed by Caroline Reid, the Cambridge president. ‘It brings the attention of another audience, people who follow Clare,’ said Reid, 24. ‘Maybe people who support the Grand National disagree but they will at least be aware it’s happening and that is a good thing.’ Wilson, a third year English literature student and Reid, in her fifth year of veterinary medicine, rise at 5.30am each day for training, gym work and lectures, then it’s back out on the river in the afternoon. Cambridge Women's Boat Crew including Wilson (front) rowing the Thames . Reid, Claire Watkins and Wilson prepare ahead of the Boat Race next Saturday . Until this year, the women’s race was held a week before the men’s at Henley. The course was 1.2 miles compared with this year’s 4.22 mile battle from Putney to Mortlake. ‘At Henley it’s straight, so conditions are largely the same the whole way down,’ said Reid. ‘Tideway conditions change because the river bends. There’s a different mental and tactical side, which is exciting.’ But Reid refuses to be seen as a pioneer. ‘The first women’s race was in 1927 and there were a lot of people against it, talking about whether women should be rowing at all and what they should be wearing, so they were the pioneers. We’re just carrying on in their footsteps,’ she said.","After decades of campaign the women's crews are to make history .

7,"Who can resist Boden’s bright knits and floral prints? I most certainly can’t writes Clare Goldwin. Well, not when it comes to my seven-year-old, Ella, anyway. For years, I’ve happily forked out on pricey but irresistibly cute items for her from Mini Boden. But when it comes to buying clothes from Boden for myself, I’ve always steered clear. Their traditional and instantly recognisable staples of cotton shifts and ‘mumsy’ jersey dresses, not to mention ‘jaunty’ prints in eye-catching colours, have always been a big no-no for me. Clare Goldwin (pictured) admits that she will sometimes fork out for Boden's brightly printed clothes for her daughter but not herself as she doesn't want to be labelled a Boden 'yummy mummy' Who wants to be labelled a Boden ‘yummy mummy’ at 50 paces, and bump into countless other mothers in identical uniforms on the school-run? For many years, Boden — which launched in 1991 — made a success of its appeal to the ‘Sloane’ market. But recently, the company has experienced more challenging times. Profits plummeted 42 per cent in 2011 and, while they rose again in 2012, they remained flat for 2013. Now, however, Boden seems to have finally cracked it, and the fashion world is raving about their latest collections. Glossy magazines have praised their spring/summer shoe range for its nods to designer brands. And they’ve even seduced the notoriously difficult U.S. market, where sales are soaring. Experts are putting the success down to the use of luxury fabrics, with more cashmere and silk mixes, plus more limited-edition pieces — so there’s less chance of bumping into someone wearing the same outfit. They’re also attracting customers by toning down their colour palette, so the look is not so ‘sweet shop’, and making many of the prints more sophisticated and subtle. So, can this latest collection keep its core, middle-class customers happy, while appealing to the more fashionable woman? With the mid-season sale now on, I tried a selection of their latest outfits to see whether this Boden sceptic could be persuaded . . . TOP TROUSERS . Colour-block coat, WAS £179, NOW £107.40; jumper, WAS £89, NOW £53.40; trousers, WERE £69, NOW £48.30; suede-heeled sandals, £119 (all boden.co.uk) I usually avoid Boden, fearing it will make me look frumpy. And on the hanger, these trousers look like a case in point — with their elasticated waist, they look like shapeless tracksuit bottoms. Once on, though, they’re bang on trend, with slim legs tapering to an elasticated cuff. I’d even wear them for an evening out — though perhaps in a plain colour. The jumper has three-quarter sleeves and cute French-knot decorations like little flowers. Meanwhile, the two-tone coat has been carefully considered, down to contrast stitching in the lining. The darker blocks are slimming, too, though the green is a bit insipid for my taste. 3/5 . FAB... IF I WAS 20! Dress, WAS £199, NOW £119.40; mules, WERE £119, NOW £89.25 . At first glance, this dress looks like classic ‘yummy mummy’ Boden. And it does me no favours — making me look mumsy, busty and frumpy. That’s not because the dress is dowdy, but because it’s too fashion-forward — and I’m too old to be wearing it. With its A-line Sixties silhouette and alarmingly thigh-skimming length, this is the sort of frock that might be found in Topshop. It would look fantastic on a lithe 20-year-old or someone more flat-chested. Sadly, it doesn’t flatter this 42-year-old mother-of-two. It’s hard to work out if this is a miss by Boden, or the company taking aim at a younger crowd. The mules are very on-trend, though, and, with their teetering heel, far from the sensible-heeled shoes I associate with Boden. 2/5 . PERKY PRINT . Geometric print dress, WAS £99, NOW £69.30; suede T-bar heels with green tassels, £119 . This purple and tangerine geometric shift is a world away from Boden’s usual floral prints. It would work well on bustier women, as the smaller pattern on the upper half helps minimise larger breasts, while the plain band accentuates the waist. The length is just above the knee, so it’s not too daring for those over 40 — though I wouldn’t want it any shorter. Meanwhile, the shoes are fab. The T-bar heels are right on trend and come with a twist: contrasting purple toes and quirky green tassel detail. Usually, ankle straps make legs look shorter by cutting them off — but here, the strap sits lower down the foot, lengthening and flattering the legs. 3/5 . FIFTIES WONDER . Floral dress, WAS £139, NOW £97.30; mules, WERE £119, NOW £89.25 . On first sight, this look screams old-style Boden — a cotton shift dress in a flower print. But, unlike the shapeless floral shifts of old, this one is cut in a very fashionable Fifties shape, with a square neckline and tulip skirt. The viscose/cotton fabric has a sheen to it, which gives a luxurious feel, and the flowers are big and bold — almost abstract — with flashes of lime that stop it all from looking too girly. It’s chintzy, but in a good way. This is also a slightly longer, more flattering, length and would be great for a wedding or summer party. The mules — this time in lime — are the perfect finishing touch. 5/5 . SLIMMING SKIRT . Cashmere jumper, WAS £99, NOW £49.50; print pencil skirt, WAS £89, NOW £62.30; suede-heeled sandals, WERE £119, NOW £95.20 . I would never have guessed this pink and green, diamond-print, cotton pencil skirt was from Boden. It’s a more eye-catching look than I’m used to wearing, and I’d usually shy away from crew-neck jumpers, too, as I think the high neckline accentuates my broad shoulders. But once on, the warm, pink sweater suits my pale colouring and the effect of the skirt is eye-catching, sharp and very slimming. The length is on the knee for me — but I’m 5 ft 10 in, so for most women, this would come in just below the knee. With 3 per cent elastane, there’s also a little forgiving stretch. I pair it with the suede sandals, this time in pink. Still love them. This look is a surprise hit. 4/5 . FLOATY DREAM . Cream silk shirt, £99; floral skirt, £99; sandals, as before . Oooh, this silk shirt and full skirt combination looks like the sort of outfit I remember my mum wearing in the Eighties. But will I look like a mumsy frump? While the skirt is in a traditional floral print, it’s not made from plain cotton, as you might expect from Boden, but has a gorgeous organza silk overlay, so it’s floaty and delicate. While the full skirt style isn’t very slimming, it’s a Fifties shape that’s right on trend and swishes nicely.

The floaty, geometric top has a very Orla Kiely-esque print, but I think it makes me look dowdy. Meanwhile, the stretchy, navy pants give me nasty flashbacks to the leggings I used to wear as a teenager in the Eighties, and they make my legs look stumpy and lumpy. However, the slingback flats in a pretty aqua are very fashion-forward — designers ranging from Jimmy Choo to Antonio Berardi have brought out pointed, flat slingbacks this season. And the aqua bag is very ladylike. 2/5 . So, am i convinced?

10,"Wolf Hall writer Hilary Mantel's award-winning second novel Bring Up The Bodies has been renamed for the American stage. The bestselling author, who once pledged not to dumb down her work ahead of its BBC debut, has revised the theatrical adaptation of her Tudor novels for a run on Broadway. In preparation, the title of her second book Bring Up the Bodies has been ditched in favour of the simpler 'Wolf Hall II'. Booker Prize award-winner Mantel, who has been reworking Mike Poulton's stage version, has also cut 'a lot of repetition' to create a tighter, better play. Scroll down for video . The bestselling author has revised the theatrical adaptation of her Tudor novels for a run on Broadway (pictured is Ben Miles as Thomas Cromwell and Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn) With more than 1,000 pages of historical drama, the story of the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell - who goes from a Blacksmith's son to one of the most powerful men in Tudor court - was never a simple read. The plays, produced by the Royal Shakespeare company and London's Playful Productions, will open at the Winter Garden Theatre in Times Square tomorrow and features the original British cast as well as director Jermey Herrin. And Mantel is convinced it will be a hit on Broadway. Warning: Hilary Mantel said she believed that the Broadway version of her books will be a hit . The British cast, including Miles as Thomas Cromwell and Paul Jesson as Cardinal Wolsey, will be going over to the U.S. as they prepare for the Broadway adaption which opens tomorrow . Nathaniel Parker, who won an Olivier award for his role as Henry VIII in the stage version of Wall Hall, told the Evening Standard: 'The play is better now than it was in London. 'Hilary has had a go at re-working it and she's cut a lot of repetition out and brought in her own words. 'I think audiences will love it.' The story was recently brought to the small screen in the BBC adaption starring  Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Mark Rylance as his adviror Thomas Cromwell. The mini-series received rave reviews when it aired earlier this year, and was dubbed BBC 2's most successful drama in a decade after drawing in four million viewers. Critics praised its story, acting and historical accuracy as makers went to such great lengths to recreate the Tudor period they used only candlelight to illuminate night-time scenes, filmed on location using special cameras. Actor Damian Lewis played Henry VIII in the hit television adaptation on  BBC of Mantel's award-winning story . Mantel, who saw sales of her books boosted by the adaptation, had said ahead of the BBC version that she refused to 'dumb down' to suit a broad television audience. The author had warned the adaption was 'complex', and she would not reduce it to 'clichés and over-simplifications'. The plays, written by Mike Poulton, sold out at Stratford-upon-Avon and quickly transferred to London, where they received critical raves, broke box office records and triumphed as the West End's biggest hit plays. Reprising their performances from the London production, Ben Miles as Cromwell, Nathaniel Parker as Henry VIII and Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn will be going over to Broadway. Mantel is currently writing her third novel in the Cromwell trilogy titled The Mirror and The Light.","Hilary Mantel has been tweaking stage version of Wolf Hall for Broadway .

11,"Cad: Poet Rupert Brooke had a string of short-lived relationships with various women before he died aged 27 in April 1915 . Poet Rupert Brooke has long had a reputation as a 'young Apollo', a symbol of innocent youth who was cut down in his prime during the senseless slaughter of the First World War. But a new haul of previously unseen letters show that he was in fact a slightly caddish womaniser who had a string of affairs without ever settling down. The documents, brought to light for the first time thanks to a £430,000 grant, show Brooke's lovers complaining about his refusal to take their relationships seriously. The letters are part of the John Schroder collection, which has spent decades in private hands but will now be available to the public after being bought by King's College, Cambridge, where the poet was a student. Brooke, who died 100 years ago today at the age of just 27, became a semi-legendary figure thanks to his early death and his popular poems such as The Soldier. His obituary was written by Winston Churchill, who called him 'all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be'. However, the letters in the Schroder collection - including 170 documents written by Brooke himself - show a somewhat different side to the great poet. King's archivist Patricia McGuire said that Brooke was 'promiscuous even for a man of his time' and carried on relationships with multiple girlfriends. 'Several women thought he was going to marry them - he may have thought that he was going to,' Dr McGuire told The Times. 'I think he was happy to spend a lot of time with as many women as he could.' Among the lovers whose affairs with Brooke are featured in the letters are Hollywood star Cathleen Nesbitt, artist Phyllis Gardner, and Laurence Olivier's cousin Noël. Lovers: Cathleen Nesbitt, left, and Phyllis Gardner, right, are among the women who had affairs with Brooke . Popular: Brooke became one of Britain's best-loved poets after his premature death . Nesbitt wrote to Eddie Marsh, Brooke's biographer, saying: 'I've no intention of marrying anybody for years to come - nor, I hope, has Rupert - though I shouldn't be in the least surprised if he settled in the wild with a squaw and a wigwam.' In another letter, she described the poet's care-free attitude in the face of the danger he submitted himself to in the war. Nesbitt wrote: 'When I talked of all things coming to an end he would always laugh and say, ""Hush - there's never any end when things are perfect.""' This is not the first time that Brooke's reputation has taken a battering - previously discovered letters have shown him expressing unpalatable views on Jews and homosexuals. And this year a book about his affair with Phyllis Gardner revealed that he opposed the women's rights movements and privately said that 'all women are beasts'. The pair bathed naked together near Grantchester, the village outside Cambridge where Brooke lived in the Old Vicarage, now home to Jeffrey Archer. Trove: Peter Jones of King's College, Cambridge with a haul of letters which the college has now bought thanks to a £430,000 grant . Home: The Old Vicarage in Grantchester, Cambridgeshire, where Brooke once lived . If I should die, think only this of me: . That there's some corner of a foreign field . That is forever England. There shall be . In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; . A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, . Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam, . A body of England's, breathing English air, . Washed by the rivers, blest by the suns of home. And think, this heart, all evil shed away, . A pulse in the eternal mind, no less . Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; . Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; . And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, . In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. Despite the recent revelations, Brooke has retained his image as a 'young Apollo' cut down in his prime, whose poems encapsulate typically English scenes. His poem The Soldier, featuring the line 'there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England', was immensely popular during the First World War, and made even more poignant when Brooke himself died while on active service on April 23, 1915. Churchill wrote in his obituary, published in The Times: 'He was all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be in the days when no sacrifice but the most precious is acceptable, and the most precious is that which is most freely proffered.' Peter Jones, the librarian at King's, said: 'It is hard to realise today just how significant Brooke's impact was 100 years ago. 'In the early 20th century as a poet you were fortunate to sell 200-300 copies of your work. Just after his death, Brooke's close friend and patron Eddie Marsh published 1914 and Other Poems. 'The first edition of 1,000 sold out immediately and, in all, 160,000 copies were sold of various impressions.' He added: 'We now know much more about Brooke as a person and he is certainly more interesting and, in some ways more difficult, than the heroic image portrayed at the time of his death. 'He was a conflicted individual. He had a major breakdown in 1912 and had disastrous relationships with the women who loved him.' One of the letters now made available reveals how Brooke's mother Mary Ruth sought to avoid turning her son into an icon, and also intervened to stop Marsh inserting details of his more sordid relationships. Lorna Beckett, chairman of the Rupert Brooke Society, said: 'He was an interesting, complex and likeable person who is still suffering from the hostile backlash brought about by the ""young Apollo"" myth created straight after his death.'","The poet has a reputation as a 'young Apollo' who died tragically young .

Kathleen Blomberg, who lived in a building badly damaged by Thursday's explosion has been reunited with her two traumatized cats, Kitty Cordelia, pictured, and Sebastian . Two people died and 22 were injured in last week's explosion, which authorities now believe was caused by an illegally tapped gas line . Blomberg was asleep in her apartment when the explosion happened and she rushed out to see to had happened. 'I thought I would have an opportunity to go back upstairs to get the cats, but as soon as we came down, they started sealing off the building,' Blomberg told CBS2. She had been desperately searching for her two cats she left behind, putting up fliers and posting on social media and she was reunited with them on Wednesday. 'I have no words, because, I mean, they're my children,' she said. 'They're not just cats.' After 21 years in the same apartment Blomberg is currently looking for new accommodation for her and the cats. A number of pets were also displaced in the rush for people to evacute their homes following the explosion. Seven cats have been missing since Thursday, but today that number thankfully dropped to four. 'I have no words, because, I mean, they're my children,' said an emotional Blomberg following the reunion . Sebastian, left, and Kitty Cordelia, right, had spent the past six days covering under Blomberg's bed in her abandoned apartment which is still under a full-vacate order .

The ASPCA, FDNY and NYPD are still working to locate other missing animals at the explosion site. Two people died and 22 were injured in last week's explosion, which authorities now believe was caused by an illegally tapped gas line. New York City's mayor says three of the four people critically injured in the fire and explosion have been released from the hospital. Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference Monday that the remaining patient was in Bellevue Hospital and 'doing well.' He said fire marshals, the NYPD and the district attorney's office were investigating the cause of Thursday's apparent gas explosion. It killed two people and leveled three buildings. De Blasio said he hasn't ruled out policy changes, or tougher penalties for those caught tampering with gas, but the investigation must conclude that first. The mayor says most residents in the surrounding area who were evacuated immediately after the blast have returned to their homes.

Rogan was pronounced dead at St. Joseph’s Hospital in the town of Marshfield. Niki, who managed to steer the van into a shallow ditch after the impact, gave birth a few hours later to a son, Blaise. The accident occurred when the deer was hit by another vehicle and thrown into the windshield of the van Rogan was driving. Friends set up a GoFundMe account to help +the family out with the goal of covering funeral expenses. Within three days almost $190,000 has been raised. Rogan, 42, was a devout churchgoer and former marine, and ran an organic seed business . Niki home-schools the children and the money will allow her to continue to do so, while also replacing the van and covering the family’s medical expenses. Rogan, originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, married Niki in 1998. He was a member of St. Mary’s Oratory in Wausau, as well as the church choir and The Holy Name Society. He would go to services about three times a week. The family attended Mass on Sunday as they always do, and a baptism for Blaise was held afterwards. ‘It was a very teary morning,’ Reverend Aaron Huberfeld of St. Mary's Oratory told the Wausau Daily Herald. Niki had called Huberfield on the morning of the crash and he had rushed to the hospital to be with them. He said that the family is doing ‘amazingly well’, given the circumstances.

Bournemouth's promotion means Arsenal will start season in second place for the first time in 100 years . Arsenal have theoretically started each season since 1915/16 at the summit of England's top tier, although the advent of the First World War meant it was only in 1919 that the club officially began their century-old record. The Gunners only finished fifth in the last pre-war competitive season, but they were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division after the First World War in 1919–20, at the expense of local rivals Tottenham. After Eddie Howe guided Bournemouth to within touching distance of the Promised Land on Monday with victory over Bolton, only a highly improbable goal-swing would deny them automatic promotion.

16,"The Tories could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it, Government chief whip Michael Gove admitted last night. Mr Gove, the former education secretary, said he could not rule out further cuts to child benefit to reduce the deficit. Asked on the BBC's Newsnight if he could confirm that there would be 'no more changes to child benefit', Mr Gove said: 'No I can't say that.' Conservative chief whip Michael Gove admitted the Tories could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it . Mr Gove said the Tories would not cut benefits for the disabled or pensioners – but refused to rule out cuts to child benefit. He said: 'There is a huge amount of welfare spending that can be reduced without having any impact on people who have disabilities. 'We're not going to hit, or take money away from, the disabled. We're going to protect people who are pensioners. What we are going to do.' Mr Gove was asked specifically: 'There will be no more changes to child benefit. Can you say that to us?' He said: 'It's not our policy at the moment. But the thing I would say is that we've succeeded over the course of the last five years, not just in making departmental cuts which I've alluded to, but in making £21billion worth of welfare cuts. All we're asking to do is to do half of that again.' Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'Michael Gove's repeated refusal to rule out child benefit cuts will only add to fears that the Tories have a secret plan to cut support to children. 'The Tories have a £12 billion black hole in their welfare plans it's clear they can't fill without hitting families with children. It's time for the Tories to come clean with the public about their plans to cut child benefit.' The revelation comes after George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term. Asked on the BBC's Newsnight if he could confirm there will be 'no more changes to child benefit', Mr Gove said: 'No I can't say that' Mr Gove's remarks came after  George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term . More than a million households lost out when the Coalition announced that families with one parent earning £50,000 would pay tax on child benefit. Earners over £60,000 lost out altogether. The controversial measure, brought in two and a half years ago as part of the Government's austerity programme, was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers. It meant anyone earning less than £50,000 – even a couple on £49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £20.70 a week for the first child, and £13.70 for every subsequent child. Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could 'rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you've already done in this Parliament?' But the Chancellor appeared to leave the door open to further cuts when asked if he would be 'depriving more families' of the payments which are worth more than £1,000 per year. Mr Osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold, only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system Universal Credit, which is being rolled out nationally. The respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that increasing Universal Credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £4.8billion a year. The Chancellor said: 'You can judge us on our record in this Parliament. If we wanted to put child benefit into Universal Credit we would have done it when we set up Universal Credit. 'We've got a track record, we've got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay, sharpening work incentives.' Asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts, he said: 'I've given you a very clear answer. We've created a welfare system where child poverty is down, inequality is down, we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable. 'We are going to carry on doing that in the next Parliament. But we can't do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy.' The Conservatives say they would cut £30billion of spending if they win a second term. Of this £12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill, with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance. While the Prime Minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension, few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family's annual benefits from £26,000 to £23,000. It is widely speculated that the Conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children, to save around £2billion a year.","Asked if he could rule out child benefit cuts Mr Gove said: 'I can't say that'

19,"A Massachusetts police department was forced to pay a $500 Bitcoin ransom to hackers who encrypted vital records on their computer network. Tewksbury Police Department came under  attack by criminals who infected their network with a form of Internet malware in December before demanding money to decrypt the files. The program called CryptoLocker infects  through an e-mail and then scrambles the data on the computer. It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier. Tewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in Bitcoinransom . The only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the Boston Globe. 'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could. 'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort' The department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files. Police became aware of the malware infection the following day. Computers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan. It is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer  became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier. CryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. CryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. Computers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads. According to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. When a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency. After this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom. As Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach. 'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier. Tewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of ransomware in the U.S. Similar incidents have occurred involving Swansea Police Department which paid a $750 ransom in November 2013, according to Town Crier. Police in Midlothian, Illinois most recently paid a $500 ransom in January.","Tewksbury Police Department was attacked by criminals who infected their network with  malware program called CryptoLocker .

20,"England Test captain Alastair Cook feared Jonathan Trott's international career was over 18 months ago, but feels he is now ready to face the 'pressure cooker' once again. Trott dramatically left the 2013/14 Ashes trip after just one match at the Gabba having struggled with what was initially labelled a 'stress-related condition' and later diagnosed as situational anxiety. Cook was concerned that would be the end of his Three Lions days but has watched the 33-year-old rebuild his career with typical focus and determination, first with Warwickshire then during a productive winter tour with England Lions. Jonathan Trott during a nets session as he returned to the international scene and could be ready to play . The pair are now heavy favourites to open the batting together in West Indies this month and should get a first chance against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI on Monday. Uncapped Yorkshireman Adam Lyth is the other top-order batsman on tour but Trott appears to have first claim after batting alongside the skipper in Saturday's centre-wicket practice session at Warner Park. 'He was in a bad place in Brisbane and at the time I would have been surprised that he'd come back, but it's a huge credit to the work he's done off the field and the effort he's put in,' said Cook. 'That obviously shows his desire to come back to play for England. Test captain Alastair Cook feels the batsman is ready for the 'pressure cooker' of international cricket . 'He has almost demanded selection with the runs he has scored for Warwickshire and it's great for me to see him back in an England shirt. He's a great guy and if he gets his chance he'll be desperate to do well.' Cook accepted there was no guarantee over how Trott would react to the glare of the international game, which remains several notches beyond anything he will have experienced on the county or Lions circuit. But with a CV boasting 49 Tests, 3,763 runs and nine centuries, Cook is delighted to have him back on board and nudging the selectors for a recall. 'I am (confident), but you don't know 100 per cent until he's put out in the environment - that is always unknown,' he said. Trott (left) and Cook train together during a batting session at Warner Park, Basseterre, St Kitts & Nevis . 'There's a lot of things about selection that are unknown until you're put into the pressure cooker of international cricket and, make no mistake, it's a high-intensity environment, there's no doubt about that. 'But Trotty's done everything we've asked of him. He feels confident in himself and he's just looking forward to taking that next step. 'What we do know is he's a quality player. You don't have his stats and that weight of runs behind you without being a quality player.' For his own part, Cook is in need of a successful series both as captain and run-scorer. The last of his 25 Test centuries came in May 2013 and he was stripped of the one-day captaincy on the eve of the World Cup, though in hindsight his absence from the tournament may have been a blessing given England's travails. The Warwickshire batsman has been in fine form for them and rightly deserved his call-up . Now, rested and recharged following his enforced spell at home, he is setting his sights on nothing short of victory in the three-Test series. 'It's been great to spend a bit of time at home, live a bit more of a normal life away from the travelling circuit of cricket,' he said. 'That's been great, at home with my family, but now it's the serious business of trying to win the series here. 'It's always important we win. When you play for England you carry the hopes and the pride of the nation on your shoulders. 'That hasn't changed since the day I started playing.'

21,"An 82-year-old woman died after sitting in the same chair in her South Carolina home for six months, authorities have said. Barbara Anne Beam was being looked after by her elderly sister and nephew when she passed away in her bedroom in Greenville on January 2. The coroner's office found she died from a blood clot in her lung and ruled that her death was homicide by neglect. Prosecutors are now deciding whether to charge the family members. Officers were called to the home on January 2 and the smell was so bad that some of the first firefighters on the scene set up a fan by the door. Scene: Barbara Beam died in her South Carolina home in January after sitting for six months and prosecutors are considering charges against her caretakers. The identity of the woman pictured is not known . An officer noticed ulcers on the back of the 200-pound woman's legs and that body fluids were staining the sunken seat of her chair, according to the police report. The sister told the officer that Beam 'stays in the chair located in the bedroom and that she had not moved out of the chair for approximately six months,' according to a police report. She added that, a few hours before her sister's death, Beam refused to eat and they watched a soap opera together in her bedroom before she went to the kitchen. When she returned, Beam was slumped in her chair and the sister and nephew could find no pulse. When paramedics took Beam out of the chair and put her on the floor, her legs were still bent in a sitting position when the officer arrived. She was not wearing pants, according to the report. When she died, she also had deep vein thrombosis, which are clots caused by sitting for long periods of time, and a serious infection that started in her kidneys, the coroner's office said. 'The decedent had significant ulcerations and wounds - pressure ulcers, essentially - on her legs from prolonged inactivity and prolonged time spent in a chair,' Dr. James Fulcher, the deputy medical examiner who performed the autopsy said, the Greenville News reported. Police have turned their file on the case over to prosecutors, who are reviewing it, Greenville Police spokesman Johnathan Bragg said on Friday.","Barbara Beam died in the home she shared with her sister and nephew in Greenville, South Carolina in January .

22,"Police are now urging witnesses of a middle-aged woman's offensive public transport tirade at a Muslim woman to come forward after Daily Mail Australia published video of the incident. Stacey Eden, 23, stood up for the Muslim woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter 'bullying' the Sydney commuter on an Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday afternoon. Ms Eden switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to Muslim couple's defence with a fiery spray notably absent any swearing. A police spokeswoman contacted Daily Mail Australia on Thursday to say they would 'definitely encourage' witnesses of the incident to come forward. In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Scroll down for video . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent. 'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport. Ms Eden told Daily Mail Australia the couple alighted the train at Sydney International Airport .

'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot. Ms Eden said the woman was saying 'horrible and hurtful things'. 'She told me if I was in their country I would have been stoned to death because I was wearing a dress. 'She was saying a lot of things I just got to the point where I had heard enough.' The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg. Mariam Veiszadeh (pictured), a lawyer and public advocate for the rights of Muslims, says incidents such as these are increasingly common . 'I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness)' Mariam has been the target of racist attacks herself . 'It was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything. People were just listening. I know they were scared,' Hina said. As for Ms Eden, she told Daily Mail Australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online, having posted the video just yesterday. 'Good on you for sticking up for whats right more people should be doing the same,' wrote punter Rachel Lambert. 'Well I don't know you but thank you, thank you for understanding,' said Shahiq Sarkar. Overwhelming response: Ms Eden has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online . 'I hope some day when you need help and are boxed in a corner someone as bright as you is there to support you just like you did for those poor souls. 'We really need to look for the best in people and understand that its a few rotten apples who try to spoil the lot. 'All the best wishes for you.' One comment even asked: 'RU single? Lol'.

23,"Switzerland is the world's happiest nation thanks to healthy GDP figures, strong social bonds and an increasing life expectancy, a new study of global wellbeing has revealed. The list is dominated by European nations, particularly those in Scandinavia, and measures a country's population by factors contributing to its citizens' contentment, rather than wealth. Britons are happier now than they were two years ago, the study found, but still ranks in at a relatively lowly 21st place. And despite often mocking its northern neighbour as an inferior nation, the United States is a full 10 places below Canada, ranking at 10th and fifth respectively. Unsurprisingly the world's least happy countries are places ravaged by war and extreme poverty - with Syria, Burundi and Togo taking their place at the bottom of the 158-nation strong list. Celebration: Switzerland is the world's happiest nation thanks to healthy GDP figures, strong social bonds and an increasing life expectancy, a new study of global wellbeing has revealed . Spectacular: Icelandic citizens are now so happy that the country jumped from number nine in 2013 to number two this year, thanks in part to their well beautiful scenery (pictured) and cultural history . The 2015 World Happiness Report is the third of its kind and is edited by a team of renowned academics and analysts - among them American economist Jeffrey Sachs and  head of the London School of Economics' 'wellbeing' programme, Richard Laynard. First published in 2012, the study uses a range of factors to determine how happy a nation is, ranging from purely domestic perspectives - such as GDP and life expectancy figures - to how its citizens view themselves and their country within the world at large. 1. Switzerland              6. Finland . 2. Iceland                     7. Netherlands . 3. Denmark                  8. Sweden . 4. Norway                    9. New Zealand . 5. Canada                   10. Australia . This year's study is the first to additionally break the statistics down by age and gender, however, with it possible for readers to find, for example, that a country ranking relatively highly overall, has a hidden population of deeply unhappy young women concerned about equal rights and pay. The top 10 on the list is dominated by nations from Scandinavia - which are unsurprisingly also among the wealthiest on the planet too. Equally unsurprising are the countries lower at the bottom of the list - almost all of which are in the midst by bloody civil war, political unrest or crushing poverty. One surprising anomaly, however, is Palestine, which came just below the midway point in the study at number 108, despite being ravaged by conflict. Happiness: The top 10 on the list is dominated by nations from Scandinavia. Citizens of these countries, such as Swedish nationals (pictured) are unsurprisingly also among the wealthiest on the planet too . Fierce rivalry: Despite often mocking their northern neighbour as an inferior nation, U.S. nationals (left) are a full 10 places below Canadians (right), ranking at 10th and fifth respectively . Low ranking: Unsurprisingly the world's least happy countries are places ravaged by war and extreme poverty - with Syria (pictured) Burundi and Togo taking their place at the bottom of the 158-nation strong list . The idea of assessing nations by the citizens level of happiness, rather than simply by wealth, is something promoted by the EU, who consider it a more accurate representation of the population as a whole. While many of the study's headline findings were relatively predictable, the wellbeing test becomes far more interesting when experts being analysing the biggest rises and falls. 149. Chad                    154. Rwanda . 150. Guinea                 155. Benin . 151. Ivory Coast           156. Syria . 152. Burkina Faso        157. Burundi . 153. Afghanistan          158. Togo . Greece, which is crippled by national debt and faces an increasingly uncertain future, is by far the fastest declining nation on the list. Other European nations that suffered the worst during the global recession, such as Spain and Italy, have also plummeted in the happiness stakes. Recent economic difficulties do not guarantee a country tumbling down the rankings, however. Both Ireland and Iceland suffered financial woes towards the end of the last decade, but the wellbeing of their populations appear to have been more affected by improvements in health and social issues. In fact Icelandic citizens are now so happy that the country has jumped from number nine in 2013 to number two, pushing the world's previously most happy nation, Denmark, down into third place thanks their country's perceived level of generosity, as well beautiful scenery and cultural history.","List is dominated by European nations - particularly those in Scandinavia .

24,"(CNN)As Americans mark the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's death this week, let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages, but also belongs, in a special way, to Illinois. Lincoln's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his Midwestern roots. He knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton. The entire region from the Appalachians to the Rockies drained through the Mississippi River, enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through New Orleans and from there to the world. He thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular, or Dixie more generally. The U.S. landmass, he insisted, ""is  well adapted to be the home of one national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more"" because ""there is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide."" Lincoln supplemented his Midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly Midwestern claim about constitutional history: ""The Union is older than any of the States; and in fact, it created them as States."" Lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case, and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the Constitution's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession. The Constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says. But Lincoln's additional assertion that the Union created the states, not vice versa, provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country. Most Virginians, including Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, insisted that of course Virginia had come first!  At the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Old Dominion was already a century and a half old. Generations of Lees had helped govern Virginia long before the United States was born. But if Lee was, first and always, a Virginian, Lincoln was an American. His father came from Virginia, his grandfather hailed from Pennsylvania, and before that, the family had probably lived in New England. Abe himself had been born in Kentucky and had moved as a boy to Indiana, and later, as a young man, to Illinois. These latter two Midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the Union itself. These places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all Americans -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life. When young Abe moved to Indiana, it was just becoming a state, thanks to federal governmental action. It was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the Lincolns and countless other Kentuckians to leave the Bluegrass State for a brighter future in the Midwest. Retracing Lincoln's assassination 150 years later . That brighter future also involved freedom from slavery. The Old Northwest had always been free soil, as provided for by a Northwest Ordinance that predated the U.S. Constitution.  The words of the 13th  Amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that Lincoln would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in America and did so by borrowing verbatim from Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance. True, geography is not inexorable destiny. Many other Midwesterners in Lincoln's era embraced slavery and secession. Hugo Black, the Supreme Court justice who did the most to make Lincoln's constitutional vision a reality over the next century, was born and raised in Alabama. But geographic variation has always been a large part of America's constitutional saga. In the 1860 election that brought him to power, Lincoln swept almost all the Northern states, but did miserably in the slaveholding south. John Wilkes Booth, the dastard who ended Lincoln's life 150 years ago this week, was an embittered extremist from a slave state. So was Lincoln's nemesis on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger Taney. Taney's most infamous ruling, the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision in 1857, had emerged from a court dominated by the South; although slave states accounted for less a third of America's free population, this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court. Remembering Lincoln's murder . In our era, given the fact that Republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years, the court has been rather moderate. Much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern Republicans on the Court -- most notably, Minnesota's Harry Blackmun, Illinois' John Paul Stevens, and New Hampshire's David Souter. All nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal New England, at Harvard or Yale, and the Republican appointee most attentive to gay rights, Anthony Kennedy, grew up in northern California, a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles. Which takes us back to Lincoln. When Anthony Kennedy was a lad in California's state capital, the governor, a friend of the Kennedy family, was a Lincoln Republican named Earl Warren -- a man who would later author the Court's iconic opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by Lincoln and his allies. Today, both parties at their best claim Lincoln. Jeb Bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and Rand Paul is a Kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach. Hillary Clinton was born an Illinois Republican. And the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from Illinois who knows how to give a good speech, and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating Lincoln's geographic coalition, winning every state within a four-hour drive of Chicago. In the largest sense, then, all Americans, of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in Illinois -- are living in the Land of Lincoln.","Akhil Amar: Lincoln's two biggest legacies, keeping union together and abolishing slavery, had Midwestern roots .
Lincoln saw the federal government as pre-eminent and believed there was no logical border for dividing the U.S."
25,"Airline rivals Ryanair and Aer Lingus have locked horns once again on Twitter. In not-so-subtle posts on the social networking site, the two carriers reignited their feud by posting tweets concerning their operation at Dublin Airport. Ryanair, run by Michael O'Leary, shared a photo of two of its staff by an advertising banner in Terminal 2, along with the words: 'Low Fares have come to @DublinAirport T2 at last. 'Fly from T1 for the lowest fares made simple.' Ryanair took to Twitter for a cheeky promotional photo in Terminal 2 in Dublin  - where Aer Lingus fly out from . In response to Ryanair's post, Aer Lingus had a dig at where Ryanair fly their passengers out too . Ryanair flies out of Terminal 1 at Dublin Airport, whereas Aer Lingus flies from Terminal 2, so it was clear the tweet was a joke at its rival's expense. However, without directly responding to the sly dig, Aer Lingus responded in fine form. Ireland's national airline tweeted: 'Fly from T2 at @DublinAirport to central locations across Europe. T1 gets you nearly there, we get you really there.' The words appear to be a reaction to Terminal 1-based Ryanair often using smaller and former military bases throughout Europe, often away from the central point of the destination city. Ryanair have been accused by rivals Aer LIngus of getting their customers 'nearly' to central locations . This isn't the first time the two have taken to Twitter to engage in some light-hearted banter. Back in January a row erupted when Aer Lingus tweeted photos and claimed one of its planes was featured in the background of an online advert for Ryanair’s ‘business plus’ service. With a smiley face emoticon for good measure, Aer Lingus gleefully wrote to its 89,000 followers: ‘Epic #photobomb by EI-DVM on Ryanair’s website! Even they know we’re Best for Business’. Aer Lingus took to Twitter to point out that Ryanair had used an Aer Lingus plane on some of its promotional material . Aer Lingus’ attempt to publicly embarrass Ryanair didn’t sit well with its low-cost rival. Ryanair responded with an affront of its own: ‘Even @AerLingus is talking about @Ryanair Business Plus. FYI, he’s smiling cos he saved a fortune & avoided another late @AerLingus arrival!’ As their Twitter followers weighed in and encouraged more banter, the Dublin-based airlines traded a few more tweets before calling it quits. Ryanair, in typical fashion, responded to Aer Lingus' post as only they would . The UK Court of Appeal is set to rule Ryanair’s 29.82 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair is the largest individual shareholder and it is set to find out if it will be forced to comply with competition regulators and sell down to no more than five per cent. Ryanair has predicted British Airways-owner IAG will return with another tilt at Aer Lingus as soon as this week. The budget airline said it is ‘actively’ seeking a buyer for its stake in Aer Lingus, which it has to sell due to competition requirements, and expects IAG to make a third offer to the group imminently. Aer Lingus and Ryanair have often taken to social networking for subtle digs at each other .","Ryanair post promo photo in Terminal 2 - where Aer Lingus fly out from .

26,"Tucked along the coastline of the second smallest country in South America, the tiny fishing village of Jose Ignacio is almost unknown around the world. But every summer, this sleepy backwater hosts the creme de la creme of the fashion world, celebrities and more than a few millionaire playboys. Staying in shabby chic cottages or sleek hotels overlooking the sea, they converge of the beach - a mass of honeyed limbs and perfect figures stretched out in the sun while planning where to party that night. The tiny village of Jose Ignacio is an understated getaway for the rich and famous, filed with pretty villas and sleek beach huts . Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood (left) and Colombian singer Shakira (right) are among the stars said to have escaped the spotlight by holidaying in the chic resort of Jose Ignacio . So, what has brought everyone from Colombian singer Shakira to Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood and restaurateur and playboy Giuseppe Cipriani - the man behind the glamorous Cipriani restaurants dotted around the world's most stylish cities - to these shores? Wedged between oversized neighbours Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay has largely stayed off the radar for European and American travellers, but has long been a favourite summer spot for South Americans thanks to its endless golden beaches and low prices. With an area of just 68,000 square miles, the country's sizeable Atlantic coastline is home to pretty villages, two major cities - the capital Montevideo and the glorious colonial Portuguese town of Colonia - while the interior is dotted with little more than estancia farms breeding cattle and growing wine. Each summer (during the American and European winter), Uruguay's beaches are taken over by well-heeled Brazilians and Argentinians looking for good food and sunshine. Even the luxury boutiques selling trinkets alongside designer products are designed in the shabby chic beach style . La Huella is one of the most famous restaurants in Jose Ignacio and a favourite with holidaymakers for its relaxed beach atmosphere . As telenovela (soap opera) actresses and Latin film stars descended on the coast, one resort in particular became the haunt of the rich and famous. Punta del Este, about 85 miles east of Montevideo, was soon known as the Miami of South America, with sumptuous hotels, pop-up restaurants run by celebrity chefs and visitors ranging from supermodels and actors to company CEOs. There are so many celebrity homes in the area that there has actually been a bus tour launched, much like the ones in LA and New York. And Punta del Este even has its own area called Beverly Hills. Naomi Campbell has visited, as have British and Spanish royalty, footballer Diego Maradona has a house nearby and even former US president George Bush has stayed. Locals and visitors stay understated in their beachwear (left) and the entrance of the village itself is posted with colourful signs by the side of the sandy roads .

While the golden beaches of Uruguay are the main draw for Argentinian and Brazilian visitors, but those coming from further afield may want to combine Jose Ignacio and Punta del Este with some other hotspots. Colonia del Sacramento is perhaps Uruguay's prettiest town, with cobbled streets and crumbling buildings left over from Portuguese and Spanish rule . Colonia del Sacramento sits across the Rio de la Plata from Argentina (Buenos Aires is just an hour away by ferry). Owing its heritage to a mix of Portuguese and Spanish colonialism - the two battled over its strategic location - it is a maze of pretty cobbled streets, bougainvillea-draped buildings and a crumbling lighthouse with panoramic views. The picture-perfect spot is doesn't take long to explore but is ideal for a couple of lazy days strolling the streets, eating in patio restaurants and enjoying the atmosphere. The capital Montevideo tends to divide opinion among travellers. Some blast the city for its high-rise buildings and lack of colonial charm (at least when compared to nearby Colonia). But the quirky capital does have some of the buzz of its rival across the water Buenos Aires, with a beautiful 19th century market near the port crammed with restaurants serving asado (barbecue beef) and endless bottles of wine. The city has a necklace of beaches which come alive in the summer time with events and eateries and there is a faded beauty in the crumbling towers and Art Deco buildings of the city. Tango bars and theatres have combined to give the city a reputation as a true cultural hub in Uruguay. If you want to head away from the cities, then travel inland to the various estancias (ranches) that dominate the country's interior. There is a good business in rural tourism here, with estancias offering stays to visitors - ranging from the basic to the super-luxurious - and the chance to ride gaucho-style on horses through the countryside, learn about their culture and tuck into the freshest asado beef there is. Website www.welcomeuruguay.com has some options listed. With so many big names rubbing shoulders in one town, it is on wonder the ultra-chic crowd started to head elsewhere for some peace and quiet - which is how they happened upon tiny Jose Ignacio, just 22 miles east along the coast. Happen upon it on a quiet day and you would never know how popular it is. The tarmac road gives way to sand at the entrance of the village, pretty clapboard houses probably look more elegant than most, and signs pointing to chic boutiques and eateries are subtle. In the centre of the village is a simple square decorated with colourful flowers. There are no high rises, no gaudy luxury hotels, just an assortment of those shabby chic-style buildings that make the perfect romantic backdrop for fashion shoots - something which is not lost on the fashion directors of the world's glossiest magazines, who flock to the area to create stylish beach spreads. The hotels in the area hide behind walls and fences, leaving them almost invisible to the average visitor, while at the same time showcasing spectacular ocean views to their guests, taking advantage of the village's location on a peninsula jutting out to sea. The suites sit in individual huts covered in grass and wildflowers and the bedrooms boast spectacular views out to sea from the floor-to-ceiling windows . The central titanium and glass structure was designed as a sculpture and the back opens up onto the terrace and infinity pool . From the restaurant, guests can stroll out on to the terrace and sit by the pool which blends in with the sea beyond . One such sleek addition is Playa Vik, built by Norwegian-born hotelier Alex Vik, it is a sleek modern design which shouldn't work with the traditional ambience of the village but somehow does. Virgin Holidays Worldwide Journeys offers a 17-day Best of South America trip from £3,829pp. The trip includes return flights from London Heathrow to Lima and returning from Rio de Janeiro, accommodation and sightseeing encompassing Lima, Yucay, Machu Picchu, Cusco, Puno, Iguassu Falls, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. Price is based on two adults sharing a standard room on a mixed board basis and includes sightseeing with experienced English-speaking guides and transfers. An additional trip to Uruguay can be added into the itinerary at an extra cost. Stone and glass huts sit under grass roofs dotted with wildflowers, blending them in with their surroundings and are organised in a circle around a central grassy area. Inside, huge stone baths and showers give the bathroom a rustic feel, while the huge bedrooms have quirky quotes scrawled across them (a favourite is: 'May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the crotch of the person who screws up your day and may their arms be too short to scratch'). The floor-to-ceiling windows provide spectacular ocean views to those lucky enough to enjoy the end properties, and there are more chances to contemplate the seascape from the rooms on the top floor of the main building - a huge rectangular titanium and glass structure designed as an enormous sculpture. Paintings hang on every wall, a cosy library gives way to a grand open room used as a casual restaurant throughout the day and evening, but the showstopper is the missing fourth wall, leading out to decking and a narrow infinity swimming pool, complete with dark tiling, which juts straight out towards the sea and is illuminated with star-like lights at night. By day, guests languidly swim while looking out to sea and across the golden sands and in the evening, the terrace is the perfect place to watch the sun go down while enjoying a glass of Uruguayan wine. It may not be as famous as its Argentine neighbour, but the beef and wine in Uruguay is just as fabulous (just don't say that to an Argentinian). During my stay, bankers, fashion designers and movie executives mingle over fresh breakfasts, discuss their plans to explore further afield and generally create a convivial atmosphere so very different from the hugs nameless, faceless hotels often found at beach resorts. Chic beach houses are the order of the day in Jose Ignacio, with understated clapboard getting a modern twist and beach attire very much on the casual side . Uruguayan painter Carlos Paez Vilaro created this fairy tale home Casapueblo in Punta del Este perched on a clifftop and looking out to sea - visitors can tor the quirky property today and learn more about the artist or stay in the part of it converted into a hotel . Playa Vik has been such a success that down the road Estancia Vik has recently opened, providing a grander, more traditional atmosphere with its luxurious 'farmhouse', but it has a similar atmosphere to its siter hotel, created by spectacular works of art on every wall, fantastic food and a personalised service (I never meet a member of staff who doesn't greet me by name). For those looking for more than relaxation on the beach, the estancia offers the chance to ride horses through the countryside like a gaucho and take to the local rivers in a kayak. The best eateries frequented by the great and good are the stylish but casual dining options on the beach. Mostrador Santa Teresita was set up by Argentinian chef Fernando Trocca, serving fresh seafood and glorious salads. Parador La Huella is one of the most popular restaurants in town and opens with the same staff every year, serving only local produce and spectacular asados (barbecues), while La Susana also boasts a beautiful beach spot and has long been famed for its glorious barbecued meat paired with wines.","Jose Ignacio is a tiny fishing village on the Atlantic coast of Uruguay - the smallest country in South America .

27,"Jerusalem (CNN)The flame of remembrance burns in Jerusalem, and a song of memory haunts Valerie Braham as it never has before. This year, Israel's Memorial Day commemoration is for bereaved family members such as Braham. ""Now I truly understand everyone who has lost a loved one,"" Braham said. Her husband, Philippe Braham, was one of 17 people killed in January's terror attacks in Paris. He was in a kosher supermarket when a gunman stormed in, killing four people, all of them Jewish. The terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, recorded the attack on camera. Philippe Braham was laid to rest in Jerusalem's Givat Shaul cemetery after the attacks, not far from where the Jewish Agency held a memorial ceremony to mourn victims of terror. ""Today we all share the same pain,"" Valerie Braham said to the assembled crowd. ""I know they protect us from above."" As Israel mourns on the nation's remembrance day, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced after his weekly Cabinet meeting that French authorities had foiled a terror plot. Valls said that France is fully mobilized following January's attack, which allowed authorities to identify and stop the planned attack. The latest news is a painful reminder of Braham's recent loss. Braham now lives for her young children. She has two daughters and one son. Braham tells them stories of their father to keep his memory alive and to keep herself strong. She pauses as she speaks, finding the right words to describe the love of her life who was taken from her. ""We had 10 years of marriage together, and we were a perfect couple. We had no problems. We didn't fight. It was like the day we were married,"" she said, holding back tears. She has told this story before, but it doesn't seem to get any easier. One month after the terror attacks in Paris, a gunman attacked a synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, killing Dan Uzan, who was working as a security guard for a bat mitzvah party. Uzan, 37, was laid to rest in Copenhagen. Like Valerie Braham, Uzan's parents attended the memorial service in Jerusalem. The recent attacks were on the nation's collective mind as mourners gathered in groups to commemorate fallen soldiers and victims of terror. The Copenhagen attack forced Braham to relive her fear. ""I have no idea,"" she said, hesitating. ""It seems they found a way to attack outside of war. It seems easy for them to attack, and it's frightening."" When asked where she feels at home, Braham doesn't hesitate. It is her most confident answer. ""In Israel. Obviously, in Israel. In God's name, we will move to Israel."" Braham said she will move her family from Paris to Israel when she is ready, but she does not want to feel like she is running away.","""We all share the same pain,"" Valerie Braham tells Memorial Day crowd in Israel .

28,"A second person is dead after a body was found in Alabama waters following a powerful storm that capsized several sailboats participating in a regatta near Mobile Bay. Major Steve Thompson with the Alabama Department of Public Safety's Marine Patrol Division said that one person was found dead on Saturday and a second was found dead on Sunday morning. During a press conference on Sunday, authorities also said crews still are searching for five people missing in the water following the Dauphin Island regatta on Saturday - which included more than 100 sailboats and as many as 200 people. Not all of the missing people were participating in the 57th annual regatta, according to authorities, and names of the missing and deceased were not released on Sunday. Scroll down for video . A second person is dead and five are missing following a powerful storm that capsized several sailboats in a regatta near Mobile Bay, Alabama on Saturday (above footage taken by someone on a boat during the storm) The regatta included more than 100 sailboats and as many as 200 people (above a camera captures a passing sailboat trying to get through the big waves during the storm) Coast Guard Capt. Duke Walker told AL.com that ten vessels were capsized or incapacitated during the storm with three of those with the regatta. Walker also said crews are using boats and airplanes to search vast portions of the bay, including the center and areas close to Dauphin Island where family members have gathered. The storm rolled through the area about 4pm and a man was plucked from the waters by the Coast Guard around 9pm, Petty officer Carlos Vega said. Families of those missing stayed overnight in a makeshift shelter hoping that on Sunday morning they would be reunited with their loved ones, according to AL.com. Survivor Robert Luiten was a member of a five-person crew with also his  18-year-old son, Lennerd when they were thrown into the bay after the storm hit. He and another crew member were rescued quickly, but he told AL.com that it took around six hours until his son was found by rescuers. Late Saturday, the pair were reunited however two of their crew were still unaccounted for.

Dauphin Island Regatta sailors gather near their docked sailboats on Saturday in Dauphin Island, Alabama where Coast Guard officials said they responded to a report of multiple capsized vessels . Kevin Maurin (above), 28, president of the Dauphin Island Fishing Rodeo who was caught in the middle of the storm with his eight-person crew, said as soon as they let the sails drop 'freaking hell broke loose' Randy Rutledge and Rhonda Morgan Gilreath of Rome, Georgia were 15 minutes from the 18-mile race's finish when the storm hit. They were left in the water for two hours before being rescued and their boat sank in the storm's aftermath. 'It was just unbelievable how high the waves were,' Gilreath told AL.com. 'They were just bashing you from every side.' 'We knew we were totally lost at sea, we did,' she continued. The storm also caused a loss of power to 23,000 residents in coastal Alabama and Dauhpin Island Park remained dark into Saturday evening, according to AL.com. Footage of what appears to be a group of five on a sailboat during the storm was posted to YouTube showing big crashing waves and strong winds. Kevin Maurin, 28, president of the Dauphin Island Fishing Rodeo, said the weather on Saturday started off with pleasant winds. Lt.

Flotilla volunteers take lunch donated by the Salvation Army of Coastal Alabama out to first responders. On Sunday, Coast Guard crews continued searching Sunday for five people missing in the water . 'They were scattered anywhere from Dauphin Island Bridge all the way out into Mobile Bay and across to Fort Morgan. It was a wide area,' said Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier . He told AL.com that race officials had cancelled the regatta before moving forward with it after an hour-delay. While he and his eight-person crew were enjoying the race, he said out of nowhere the storm hit and in a quick-thinking move that likely saved them from ending up in the water, the captain ordered the boat's two sails to be lowered. 'It was a great day, everybody on the boat was having fun,' Maurin told AL.com. 'All of a sudden, within seconds, boom.' 'As soon as they [sails] dropped, freaking hell broke loose,' he continued. 'I was in the middle of it and it was terrible.' On Saturday, Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier told Al.com  that one person was confirmed dead, but he did not know the cause. 'We knew we were totally lost at sea,' said regatta participant Rhonda Morgan Gilreath, right, shown with her boyfriend Randy Rutledge of Rome Georgia on Saturday .

Susan Kangal, who was on a boat, told WSFA it was the worst storm that she has seen. 'We were probably an inch from capsizing; everybody was ready to jump. I didn't have a life jacket on,' she said. The boats were part of the 57th iteration of the race. 'Apparently there were a number of vessels that became distressed, either capsized or what have you,' the mayor said. 'They were scattered anywhere from Dauphin Island Bridge all the way out into Mobile Bay and across to Fort Morgan. It was a wide area,' said Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier. Authorities said not all of the missing people were participating in the 57th annual regatta on Dauphin Island (above) AL.com reported that Richard Mather, 52, of Mobile, was aboard a 39-foot O'Day sailboat along with seven people, when he saw two boats collide. He said that they expected thunderstorms but not as severe as they were. 'But we were not prepared for a gale,' Mather said, 'which is almost like a 30-minute hurricane.' Mather was not in the race and was able to pull three people onto his vessel about two miles north of the Dauphin Island Bridge. He said the boaters seemed extremely tired but none of them were injured. 'They were exhausted but they were fine,' he said. 'Their boats sunk so fast that they didn't have time to grab life preservers.'","Major Steve Thompson with the Alabama Department of Public Safety's Marine Patrol Division said a second person was found dead on Sunday .

29,"Liverpool FC are set to take action against a fan who said that two Muslim men praying at the club's stadium were a 'disgrace'. Stephen Dodd caused outrage when he posted a photograph online showing solicitors Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula worshipping during half-time of a FA Cup game. Now club authorities say they will 'take appropriate action' against the supporter, which could include banning him from matches. Fury: Stephen Dodd took this photograph of Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying at Anfield last month . Dodd took a photograph of the two men during a match against Blackburn Rovers last month, with the caption: 'Muslims praying at half time at the match yesterday #DISGRACE.' After facing a huge online backlash he continued to defend himself - saying that he had the right to criticise the men because he is a long-standing Liverpool supporter. Police investigated the incident after receiving complaints from furious web users, but have now passed on the case to the club to investigate. Liverpool FC said in a statement: 'Last month, Liverpool Football Club received complaints of a tweet showing an image of Muslim fans praying during half-time at Anfield accompanied by comments that were offensive to the complainants. 'The club reported the tweet, which was posted online on Sunday, March 8, 2015, to Merseyside Police. Backlash: Dodd tried to defend himself by saying that he was a long-standing fan of Liverpool . 'Merseyside Police investigated the matter and has referred this to LFC to take appropriate action against the individual involved. The club is currently in the process of determining the appropriate action to take and a further update statement will be made in due course. 'Liverpool Football Club would like to remind its supporters that it does not tolerate any form of discrimination and is committed to ensuring that the club and Anfield provides a welcoming and safe environment for all fans regardless of race, religion, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation.' Mr Bodi, 46, from Preston, whose eight-year-old son Ayman can also be seen in Dodd's photo, told the Liverpool Echo: 'My little boy said at the time, ""Someone is taking a picture of us,"" and I thought maybe it was someone who hadn't seen prayers before. 'I certainly didn't expect to be called a disgrace for doing it. But the support since has been very nice and I'm thankful.' Match: The incident took place when Liverpool were playing Blackburn Rovers at Anfield in March . He added: 'We have a small window in which to pray, a bit like the transfer window in football. Once that closes the chance has gone. 'That day, the time came for prayer and the window would have closed before the game finished so we did it at half-time. 'Most people are absolutely fine with it and the stewards at Anfield are wonderful, but it only takes one or two people to react in the wrong way and you could have a nasty situation.' Mr Bhula, 37, who has known Mr Bodi since childhood, offered to meet with Dodd to explain the importance of prayers in Islam. He said: 'We've had a lot of nice comments since and I appreciate that. We weren't harming anybody. 'Education is key to stopping things like this from happening. Maybe the man who took the photo has not come across Muslims before who have explained the significance of prayer. 'I would be quite happy to meet with him to explain why we pray and when it needs to be done.'","Stephen Dodd photographed Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying during half-time at Anfield last month .

30,"Judd Trump was in confident mood after safely moving through to the second round of the Betfred World Championship in Sheffield. Trump led 7-2 overnight and many thought he would make light work of Stuart Carrington but he was made to battle before eventually securing a 10-6 victory. The 25-year-old closed with a century and will now face Marco Fu in the next round. Judd Trump beat Stuart Carrington 10-6 on Thursday in the first round of the World Championship . 'I'm just going to focus on my own game,' he told BBC Two. 'If I play how I know I can, I'll win it.' A re-rack was required in the 10th frame but that did not distract Carrington who produced a break of 97 to reduce the gap to four. Trump took the next with a streak of 74 but a 74 of his own from Carrington followed by a run of 70 in the next meant it was 8-5 at the interval. Carrington got amongst the balls after the interval but was halted at 24 and Trump swept in with a 76 to move within one frame of victory. Grimsby potter Carrington showed his mettle, though, with a 99 in the next before a closing 109 from Trump put an end to his campaign. And the 2011 finalist was quick to praise his opponent, who was making his Crucible debut. Trump (pictured) led 7-2 from Wednesday and got the job done despite a good display by Carrington . 'He played really well considering it's his first time here,' he said. 'Second session he hardly missed a ball. He probably won't take as much credit as he would if it was a top player making those breaks. 'He played as good as anyone I've seen first time here.' Trump is one of the crowd favourites wherever he plays and admits there is a weight of expectation on him this year. 'There's obviously a lot of anticipation this year,' he added. 'My results have shown that I'm playing some good stuff, I felt like I played well over the past two days. 'There's obviously a few things I need to work on but other than that I feel very confident. 'It was nice for Stuart to play as he did, it just shows there is always stuff to work on and you won't get many sessions where someone plays that well.' After being five frames behind, Carrington closed the gap to three before Trump earned the victory . At the press conference following his win, Trump was asked about the footwear problems encountered by long-time rival Ronnie O'Sullivan, whose 10-3 victory over Craig Steadman required a change of shoes. Having started Tuesday's match in a new pair of shoes, O'Sullivan discarded them due to the acute discomfort they were causing him; he briefly played in socks before accepting tournament director Mike Ganley's shoes which 'felt great' to him. Of the incident, Trump said: 'I didn't really see it but I heard about it. Obviously, he likes attention. I don't know if he's done it on purpose or not, who knows?' As to the overall favourite for the World Championship, Trump was quick to divert attention away from O'Sullivan, adding: 'In my eyes, I think Neil's (Robertson) probably the underdog, . Ronnie O'Sullivan was forced into borrowing a pair of shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley . 'I think Neil's favourite to win the tournament. Neil and Mark (Selby) are going to be the toughest two. Ronnie is obviously a good player but I'm confident of beating anyone.' On the other table, defending champion Mark Selby was locked in a tough battle with Anthony McGill in the opening second round match. Selby, who needed to scrap for a 10-9 win over Kurt Maflin in the first round, got off to a slow start as he surrendered the first two frames. The first was a scrappy encounter but a break of 63 sealed the second for McGill before runs of 51 and 46 saw Selby on the board. The Leicester cueman then levelled things up at the mid-session interval with a 65 and an 87 at the third time of asking saw him edge ahead. Defending champion Mark Selby closed the session at 4-4 with Anthony McGill in their second round match . McGill was not daunted, though, and breaks of 74 and 73 in the next two saw him take a 4-3 lead before Selby drew level again to end the session at 4-4. Shaun Murphy, the 2005 world champion and current Masters title holder, conceded just the one additional frame to his overnight lead of 7-2 as he wrapped up a 10-3 win over Robin Hull. Murphy's first frame on Thursday was a tight affair at 56-55 and he went on to win the next 64-33. Finland's Hull was able to pick up frame 12 but Murphy's wrapped up the contest with a break of 111. It sealed his passage to the second round where he will meet Joe Perry, who had beaten Zhang Anda 10-4. Shaun Murphy wrapped up victory against Finland's Robin Hull with a 10-3 win on Thursday . Ding Junhui has a chance of progressing past John Higgins after his break of 94 sealed frame eight to leave the Chinese 5-3 down going into Friday's session. Higgins had picked up back-to-back frames at the start without much fuss, including 81 on the first, though Ding's class showed in a 135 break in the third. Four-time World Championship winner Higgins then threatened to walk away with the match by winning three frames on the bounce, starting with 116-6 in the fourth and going on to lead 5-1. However, Ding fought back in the closing stages to narrow the deficit, though he did miss out on a second century break of the match after failing to pot the black, on what was to prove the last shot of the day.","Judd Trump beat Stuart Carrington 10-6 in the first round at the Cucible .

31,"France legend Serge Betsen tells Sportsmail where he thinks Clermont's clash with Saracens at Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be won... HEAD TO HEADS . Wesley Fofana v Brad Barritt . If there is one genius in French rugby at the moment, it’s Wesley Fofana. The kid is so talented and skilful that something happens every time he gets the ball so Saracens will need to focus on him. He is up against Brad Barritt, who is not as easy on the eye but is a very solid unit for Saracens — hence why they have made him captain. He reminds me of former British Lions flanker Richard Hill — someone you don’t really notice but is so important for the team. Clermont centre Wesley Fofana was in scintillating form during his side's recent destruction of Northampton . Brad Barritt is back to anchor the Saracens midfield against the Top 14 giants . Julien Bonnaire vs Billy Vunipola . Julien Bonnaire may be a flanker and Billy Vunipola a No 8, but when you play flanker, you’re the first man who is going to tackle the No 8. Saracens will be looking to launch Vunipola as chief ball-carrier from the back of the scrum and Bonnaire will be there to stop him. Fritz Lee performs a similar running role for Clermont, but Vunipola is key to Saracens’ game plan. No 8 Billy Vunipola is a Saracens' most devastating ball carrier and his power will be needed on Saturday . Brock James v Charlie Hodgson . How will Brock James handle the occasion? His skills and game management are second-to-none, but he has been known to succumb to the pressure on the big stage. Saracens will try to get in his face early to disrupt the rhythm. Charlie Hodgson has been around for a long time now and is enjoying some good form. KEY AREAS . Rush defence . A red and black wall of defenders stopped Clermont from scoring a try in last year’s semi-final, which Saracens won so ruthlessly. Their defensive line was up so quickly and Clermont were taken by surprise. When you play against that sort of rush defence, you need to stand deeper in attack and maybe exploit it by kicking over the top. But Clermont are most effective with the ball in hand, especially with their back-three combination of Noa Nakaitaci, Naipolioni Nalaga and Englishman Nick Abendanon. Former Bath full back Nick Abendanon is just one of several dangerous backs at Clermont's disposal . Breakdown battle . In France, training is geared more towards flair and creativity so less time is spent working on the breakdown. During my time with Wasps, we spent hours focusing on the post-tackle area. Clermont will fear Jacques Burger after his performance on the flank last year and they must work hard to nullify him around the edges of the breakdown. The key for the French is to keep their discipline and not concede penalties. Clermont will be wary of Saracens flanker Jacques Burger following his tour-de-force in Twickenham last year . Silence the crowd . Although this game is being played at a ‘neutral’ venue, it will still feel like a home game for Clermont. The Top 14 side have the best supporters in French rugby and it’s only a 90-mile journey to the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in St Etienne for their fans, who follow their side everywhere. Saracens must be wary of the reception they’ll get but they can keep the fans quiet by building an early lead. When Clermont are behind, their heads can drop. But my gut tells me they will come away with the win today. Clermont warm up in front of their fans at Stade Marcel Michelin before their Top 14 game against Oyonnax .","Saracens skipper Brad Barritt will line up opposite Wesley Fofana .
Flanker Julien Bonnaire will be tasked with stopping Billy Vunipola .

32,"Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.","University of Montana student studied recoveries after a workout .

33,"Gruesome death rituals performed 1,200 years ago have been uncovered in dozens of tombs in Peru's Cotahuasi Valley. Each tomb was filled with bones of up to 60 mummies, with infants kept in small containers, and others repeatedly ripped to pieces while decomposing. Archaeologists have so far opened up seven of the tombs, recovering 171 broken mummies from the ancient ceremonial site known as Tenahaha. Gruesome death rituals performed 1,200 years ago have been uncovered in dozens of tombs in Peru's Cotahuasi Valley. Pictured is the burial of a young woman found in the middle of one of the tombs. Analysis of her skeletal remains reveal that she suffered dental problems, including the loss of teeth . 'When we think of the dead, we bury the relative and that's it,' Justin Jennings, a curator at Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum told DailyMail.com. 'But back then, in the Andes, you continued to interact with those folks. People were moving bodies around all the time.' The mummies in the tombs ranged in age from several days old to the elderly. But over the years rats had eaten away many of the remains, leaving only fragments. In one tomb, researchers discovered 400 isolated human body parts, including teeth, hands and feet. The few mummies that remained intact were bound by rope and placed in a foetal position. The mummies in the tombs ranged in age from several days old to the elderly. But over the years rats had eaten away at many of the remains. This image shows three vessels found by the feet of an individual. The mummies were buried with a variety of items including some beautifally decorated ceramic, pictured . Pictured is the partial skull of an individual found in one of the seven opened tombs. The dead, numbering in the low thousands, towered over the living from in their tombs high on the hills around the valley . 'On occasion, there were mummies that were placed as offerings around the outside of the tombs,' said Jennings. The Middle Horizon period (A.D. 600–1000) was a time of sweeping cultural change in the Andes. Archaeologists have long associated this period with the expansion of the Wari state in the south-central Andes and coastal area of modern-day Peru. Along with their expansion, came widespread violence. Skull fragments in some areas of their territory reveal that 50 per cent had dents in their heads caused by violent blows. Pottery in these areas were etched with drawings of fanged teeth and human trophy skulls. But Tenahaha was believed to have been a relatively peaceful area in Peru at that time. In Tenahaha, only one per cent of skulls had dents. The pottery at the site is also decorated with what looks like depictions of people smiling. Tenahaha may have served as a 'neutral ground' where people could bury their dead and feast. 'They were broken apart but then placed back together in an anatomically correct position.' Scientists are still trying to understand why some of the mummies and artefacts were broken up in this way. One theory is that the movement of the mummies may have helped create a sense of equality among the community. There is also evidence that the rituals went on for days at a time, with parties being held in the valley below the tombs. Jennings said that the dead, likely numbering in the low thousands, towered over the living from in their tombs high on the hills around the valley. 'It seems to be a place where people were bringing down their dead to that location,' said Jennings. 'They were having parties. There is evidence that they were making and drinking corn beer, and placing offerings underneath them.' But he adds that the picture remains blurry, as the rituals were performed over many years, and likely changed during that time. A study of pottery at the site suggests it was used between about A.D. 800 and A.D. 1000, with the Inca settling there 500 years later. Tenahaha was believed to have been a relatively peaceful area in Peru during those years. Pictured is a dismembered mummy. A tupu, which was an artifact that could have been used to fasten clothing, fell through this mummy’s rib cage when it was moved . Tenahaha appears to have been created as a place where people from nearby villages could feast. Parties, that lasted for several days at a time, were often held in the valley below the tombs. This image shows a storage area where food for feasting could have been kept . Pictured are some of the decorated cups found in the tombs. Human hands, lines, dots and happy faces can be seen. Pottery found in other parts of Peru had more gruesome images, largely due to a culture of violence . The wider area, however, was undergoing dramatic change, with populations growing, agriculture expanding and class differences emerging. At this time, the Wari was being established in the south-central Andes and coastal area of modern-day Peru. And with it came widespread violence. Skull fragments on the islands close by revealed that 50 per cent had dents in their heads caused by violent blows. Pottery in these areas were etched with drawings of fanged teeth and human trophy skulls. In Tenahaha, only one per cent of skulls had dents. The pottery at the site is also decorated with what looks like depictions of people smiling. Jennings believe Tenahaha may have served as a 'neutral ground' where people could bury their dead and feast. 'We have finished the excavations, and we're now trying to look at a different sites nearby during the same period to understand the relationship,' Jennings added. Cotahuasi Canyon near the city of Arequipa in Peru is the deepest canyon in the world, and a site of archaeological significance. The canyon is an impressive chasm that the river has eroded between two enormous mountain massifs: the Coropuna and the Sulimana . Scientists are still trying to understand reasons why some of the mummies and artefacts were broken up in this way. One theory is that the movement of the mummies may have helped create a sense of equality among the community.

34,"Christian Benteke faces a substantial pay cut if his goals are not enough to keep Aston Villa in the Premier League – but is set to attract interest should he continue his scoring streak. Whatever Villa's Premier League status this summer, Benteke's future will be discussed as his contract, worth £50,000 per week, enters its final two years and the Belgian striker has ambitions to play European football. Wolfsburg have kept tabs on Benteke since before he ruptured his Achilles 12 months ago and remain on the lookout for a striker. The wealthy German club, currently second in Bundesliga, should have funds available from Champions League money, even after their £42million splurge on Chelsea duo Kevin De Bruyne and Andre Schurrle. Christian Benteke celebrates his opening goal against QPR at Villa Park on Tuesday . Villa value their top scorer at £25million however, and even then would remain hugely reluctant to sell with manager Tim Sherwood a big fan. Randy Lerner is set to offload the club come the closed season and new owners will have their own thoughts. A hat-trick by Benteke in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers, capped by a brilliant free-kick, underlined his return to form under Sherwood. He has scored seven goals in his last five Villa games, earning the team an additional three points in the process – the current gap to the drop zone. Benteke went on to net a hat-trick which salvaged a vital point for his side . But should Villa slip below the dreaded dotted line and out of the Premier League, Benteke is in line for an approximate 30 per cent reduction on his wages to £35,000 a week. The 24-year-old would look to leave Villa Park in that scenario, rather than play in the Championship, with a host of clubs likely to express interest. There is, however, no relegation release clause. Even if Villa stay in the Premier League Benteke will assess his options. Two years ago he handed in a transfer request to try to force a move to Tottenham Hotspur following his debut season in England yielding 23 goals. The arrival of Tim Sherwood at Villa Park has rejuvenated Benteke's form in front of goal this season . He signed a new four-year deal on vastly improved terms. Last season was less successful, bringing 11 goals before serious injury struck last April ruling Benteke out of the World Cup. His form suffered on return to the side last October, and at times he cut a bereft figure starved of service under Paul Lambert's regime. Lambert even dropped Benteke in his penultimate game in charge at home to Chelsea. Sherwood's arrival has seen Benteke return to his best, with a goal every 87 minutes. That kind of strike rate should keep Villa up, but also alert top-flight clubs. Spurs are looking to sign young players around the £15million mark, though, while Liverpool would need to shift Mario Balotelli. Jack Grealish is convinced Benteke's goals will ensure Villa's Premier League survival this season . Benteke is comfortable with life in Birmingham and at Villa, but holds desires to play higher up the league and in continental competitions. Qualification for the Europa League is still a possibility through the FA Cup for Villa, of course. Teenage winger Jack Grealish, who started his first Premier League match against QPR, is adamant Benteke will help keep Villa safe. 'Yes, when you have Christian in the team who can score goals every game,' he said. 'We are going to go in Saturday's game (at Spurs) positive. 100 per cent we will stay up.'","Christian Benteke is currently paid £50,000 per week at Aston Villa .

35,"Iran's President Hassan Rouhani (above) has pledged to abide by the commitments of a nuclear agreement that promises to end years of crippling sanctions . Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has pledged to abide by the commitments of a nuclear agreement that promises to end years of crippling sanctions. Residents danced in the streets, blared their horns and joyously waved their national flag following the breakthrough deal. The agreement between Iran and the West, struck after a 12-year stand-off, aims to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon in exchange for phased sanction relief. Mr Rouhani also called on world powers to fulfil their part of the deal. Speaking after the announcement he said: 'Everything we promised in the nuclear talks ... we will remain loyal to and stand by our promises. 'The world must know that we do not intend to cheat.' David Cameron and Barack Obama insisted the deal was 'strong'. The marathon talks between Iran and the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany in Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva, had run over their deadline by more than two days with many fearing a deal was not possible. But last night, the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini announced Iran had agreed to restrictions on its enrichment of material that can be used either for energy production or in nuclear warheads. Under its terms, Iran would scale down plans to enrich uranium and make weapons-grade plutonium in return for Western powers dropping stringent economic sanctions. They will also be subjected to inspections. If they are found to be in violation of the terms, the sanctions will be put back in place. Iranians celebrated in Tehran last night after a historic deal was struck between Iran and six world powers . The deal promises to end years of crippling sanctions against Iran and locals could not contain their joy . Mohammad Javad Zarif milks the applause of the crowd after securing the agreement in Lausanne . A man holds up a £5 note out of his car to mark the lifting of stringent sanctions on Iran last night . The powers hope the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian programme. Iran and the six world powers must now finalise the deal by June 30. Negotiations on a comprehensive deal will begin in days. After learning that economic and financial sanctions will be rolled back, Iranians danced in the streets, flashing victory signs and brandishing US dollar notes. In Tehran, there were jubilant scenes as locals - many hanging out of cars - celebrated by unfurling national flags and punching their fists in celebration. A new chapter of 'cooperation with the world' will begin when the final deal goes into effect after July, Mr Rouhani said. He said: 'Our enrichment and entire nuclear technology is only for the development of Iran. It will not be against regional countries or against the world. There were joyous scenes in Tehran last night as Iranians waved flags and gave the victory salute . Iranians flash the victory sign from their car while celebrating the breakthrough deal in Switzerland last night . The plans agreed in Switzerland lay the ground for a new relationship between Iran and the six world powers . Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, arriving home, called the agreement a 'win-win outcome' Crucially for Iranians, economic and financial sanctions relating to its nuclear programmes will be rolled back . 'Some think we have no option except to fight the world or to surrender. But there is a third way, too. We have to have cooperation with the world.' Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was mobbed by ecstatic supporters as he arrived at the Mehrabad airport in Tehran after securing the historic deal in Switzerland. He reassured Iranians that the country's nuclear programme will continue but said any negotiation requires give and take. He said: 'Our programme is exclusively peaceful, has always been and always will remain exclusively peaceful. 'Our facilities will continue. We will continue enriching, we will continue research and development.' He added a planned heavy water reactor will be 'modernised' and that the Iranians would keep their deeply buried underground facility at Fordo. 'We have taken a major step but are still some way away from where we want to be', Mr Zarif said, adding that the preliminary step was a 'win-win outcome'. Tuned in: Philip Hammond said the deal would 'provide reassurance that the programme is peaceful' This map helps demonstrate how Iran's nuclear programme is spread across the country - the agreement hopes to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon . A Tehran resident, Alireza, 37, told CNN: 'Things can't get worse than they are so, I'm happy with this news. 'This is pretty historic and I pray that my children will be able to live in an Iran that can play nice with the international community.' But the news was not welcomed by all, with Iran's hard-liners describing it as a disaster for Iran. Hossein Shariatmadari, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and editor of the hard-line Kayhan daily, said Iran had exchanged its 'ready-to-race horse with a broken bridle'. On a visit to Chorley today, the Prime Minister hailed the 'strong' deal struck in Lausanne. Mr Cameron said: 'I believe this is a great deal and a strong deal. We are all concerned about Iran getting nuclear weapons but what this deal does is block all the pathways to a nuclear weapon, and then have proper inspection and verification. 'Crucially the sanctions that have done so much to bring Iran back to the table, they don't come off unless Iran implements its side.' Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the deal would 'provide reassurance that the programme is peaceful'. Chinese Ambassador to the UN Wu Hailong, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, an unidentified Russian official, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and US Secretary of State John Kerry, who secured the preliminary agreement in Lausanne . From left Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond speaks to US Secretary of State John Kerry as European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat take their positions before making a statement on the Iranian deal . 'This is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago and a good basis for what I believe could be a very good deal,' he said last night. 'But there is still more work to do. The fine detail of any deal will be very important, in particular specifics of oversight measures and mechanisms for handling UN Security Council resolutions. 'Diplomats and technical experts from all sides will work intensively over the coming weeks to finalise the detail by the end of June. Sanctions will remain in place until the comprehensive deal is agreed and implemented.' He added: 'Talks were extremely tough. We always said we would never agree a bad deal. This outcome is testament to the persistence and willingness of all sides to be flexible in finding solutions to seemingly intractable problems. 'It demonstrates what can be achieved when international partners work together in pursuit of a common goal.' Speaking at the White House Rose Garden, Mr Obama said that 'if Iran cheats, the world will know it' Mr Obama staked the reputation of his administration on reaching what many believed was an unlikely deal . Mr Obama urged a more cautious note following the breakthrough. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden yesterday, he said: 'If we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully. But, he added: 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it.' And 'If there is backsliding' and Iran doesn't meet certain specifications 'there will be no deal.' US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted there was still progress to be made when the deal was signed. He said: 'We have no illusions about the fact that we have a ways to travel. We still have many technical details that have to be addressed.' Following the deal, Israeli leaders immediately raised concerns, vowing to fight any agreement before it is finalized in the coming months. Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the Iran nuclear deal, claiming it threatens the Jewish state and puts his people in mortal danger . One of Netanyahu's scathing comments was shared on his Twitter page during his speech . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a leading critic of the nuclear talks, stressing he believes it will leave too much of Iran's nuclear infrastructure intact. After speaking to the US President on the phone, he said in a televised statement just hours after the agreement was signed: 'A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.' He added: 'Such a deal would not block Iran's path to the bomb. It would pave it.' It prompted Netanyahu to urge more pressure to be placed on Iran by Western powers until a better deal is reached. Israel's Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, who oversees the monitoring of the nuclear programme, claimed the deal was 'disconnected from the sad reality' of the region. He added: 'Since the declaration is far from being a real agreement, we will continue in our efforts to explain and persuade the world in the hope of preventing a bad agreement, or at least to insert corrections and improvements.' The preliminary agreement announced in Switzerland on Thursday is spelled out in a four-page document (below) released by the White House and the State Department. Here's some of what Iran is agreeing to do: . In return, the West will: . Obama insisted that: 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it'.

39,"Tate Ricks (pictured above), nine, was reportedly fishing with his grandma's boyfriend when their boat capsized and he was not found at shore . Authorities are searching a Florida river for a nine-year-old boy who went missing after a boat carrying him and a family friend was hit with a wake causing the boat to capsize. Putnam County Sheriff's Office said Tate Ricks immediately went under water in the St Johns River and the unidentified man with him attempted to save Ricks but could not, according to CBS. The man was able to make it to shore, deputies said. On Sunday, officials said they were using sonar and thermal imaging in the water and on the coastline in efforts to rescue the boy, Captain Joe Wells told First Coast News. Officials also said they plan to continue the air search later in the day bringing in divers. They hope to continue the search as long as conditions are safe, and stated previously the operation is for a rescue and not a recovery. Ricks, a third grade student at Kelly Smith Elementary School in Palatka, was reportedly with his grandmother's boyfriend fishing when the boating accident occurred. Their 14-foot johnboat was hit by the wake from a large boat around 5.30pm, according to News4Jax. The boy is believed to not have been wearing a life jacket, according to investigators, and the impact from the wake sent them both into the river. Crews began a rescue operation on Saturday around 6pm, and officials did confirm they discovered the capsized boat. Authorities said the search area for Ricks includes the St Johns River from US-17 to Memorial Bridge to the north, and Pico Road to the south . The Wildlife Conservation Commission is leading the investigation and the sheriff's office is leading the search, according to The Florida Times-Union. 'We are not going to send crews home tonight. They will remain on the river all night long,' Wells told News4Jax. 'We will switch to a different crew in the morning and continue right on through the weekend, into next week, whatever it takes to locate this young man and bring closure to his family.' A woman who identified herself as Ricks' grandmother said the family is working to stay positive. Suzette Guess told News4Jax: 'Everybody's just trying to hang together. Come together and do a lot of praying.' She described Ricks as a 'fun-loving kid' who liked hunting, fishing and NASCAR. 'Pray that they find him and that's he's okay. Just remember us and his mama. He's got a little sister think of her too,' she added. Wells told Times-Union that the incident is being investigated as a boating accident and that no foul play is suspected.","Tate Ricks was reportedly fishing with his grandmother's boyfriend in Florida when boat was hit by wake in St Johns River on Saturday .

The riot erupted in February 2012 when supporters of home team Al-Masry - from the canal city of Port Said - and Cairo's Al-Ahly clashed after an Egyptian  league match between the two clubs. An appeals court ordered the retrial of 73 defendants last year after rejecting a lower court's verdict, which sentenced 21 people to death. Scroll down for video . Eleven football fans have had their death sentences upheld after a retrial over a stadium riot (pictured) in Egypt which left 74 people dead . The riot (pictured) erupted in February 2012 when supporters of home team Al-Masry - from the canal city of Port Said - and Cairo's Al-Ahly clashed after an Egyptian league match . The clashes in the Port Said stadium (pictured) sparked days of violent protests in Cairo, which led to another 16 deaths . Eleven of the fans were again sentenced to death today, with their verdicts referred to Egypt's supreme court, the Grand Mufti. The court will make a final decision on their fates, as well as those of the other defendants, on May 30. The 73 defendants include nine police officers and three officials from Al-Masry club, while the rest were fans of the team. Two of those sentenced to death are on the run. None of the families of the victims or of the defendants attended today's court session, which was held in Cairo for security reasons. The clashes in the Port Said stadium sparked days of violent protests in Cairo, in which another 16 people were killed in fighting with security forces. The football riots (pictured) were the deadliest ever seen in Egypt, where football fans regularly clash with rival supporters and security forces .

A year later, dozens of people also died in the canal city during riots which started after the lower court handed down the 21 original death sentences. The football riots were the deadliest ever seen in Egypt, where football fans regularly clash with rival supporters and security forces. The authorities reacted by imposing a ban on fans attending  matches and held games behind closed doors. This year at least 22 people died in a stampede after police fired tear gas at fans trying to force their way into a stadium in Cairo, leading the authorities to suspend the Egyptian league. Television footage showed crowds of supporters squeezed inside a narrow metal enclosure, jostling to enter the stadium when the stampede began as police fired tear gas. The police blame the unrest on Islamists. Sixteen suspects accused of clashing with police on that day have been arrested and will face trial.

The England striker failed to train again on Thursday as Brendan Rodgers stepped up preparations for Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, meaning Sturridge hasn’t been involved in any outdoor work since before the quarter-final replay against Blackburn. Liverpool still have two more sessions before they travel south but Sturridge, who missed Monday’s 2-0 win over Newcastle United with tightness in his hip, would have to involved in at least one to stand any chance of starting at Wembley. Daniel Sturridge faces a fight to be fit for Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Sunday . Striker Sturridge was left out of the squad against Newcastle on Monday after being taken off at Blackburn . It would even appear touch and go as whether Sturridge will be fit enough to make Rodgers’ 18-man squad, given how tormented he has been with fitness issues this season. Liverpool will give Sturridge every chance to prove his fitness but the signs at present are not encouraging. The injury is a continuation of the problem he sustained in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on March 22. Sturridge missed England’s games against Lithuania and Italy with what England manager Roy Hodgson called ‘a small tear’ in his hip. Sturridge admitted last week he will not be back at his sharpest until next season and he will be glad to see the back of this campaign, having missed more than five months with a combination of thigh and calf problems. Steven Gerrard could return at Wembley after seeing out the last game of his suspension against Newcastle . Liverpool captain Gerrard holds a '96' balloon at the Hillsborough memorial service on Wednesday . If, as appears likely, the 25-year-old is forced to play a minor role, it would leave Rodgers a decision to make with regards his starting line-up, as Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is available having served a three-match suspension. Gerrard, whose 35th birthday falls on the same day as this year’s FA Cup final, missed several games in February and March with a hamstring problem but when he was fit for matches against Swansea and Manchester United, Rodgers decided to use him from the bench. He will be desperate to play at Wembley and Rodgers, who will be without cup-tied winger Jordon Ibe, must decide whether to keep faith with his current midfield of Lucas Leiva, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen or alter his system to fit Gerrard back in. Rodgers will be without Jordon Ibe who is cup-tied having represented Derby in the FA Cup this season . Joe Allen says playing in these type of games is why he joined Liverpool from Swansea . Playing at Wembley will be a new experience for a number of Liverpool’s squad and Allen says a positive result against Villa is required to enhance their development. Liverpool are favourites to reach the final but the Wales international maintains there is no complacency in the group. ‘It’s the reason you join a club like this — the dream of competing for the top prizes and potentially getting some silverware,’ said Allen. ‘There’s a huge incentive for every player here. Villa had a great result on the weekend so they will be raring to go just like we will be. ‘That will make for a great game at a historic venue. Every single player wants to ensure we get ourselves back there for the final. Everyone is ready to make that leap. We are generally a young squad who are gathering experience and getting better all the time.’","Liverpool face Aston Villa in FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday .

42,"I conducted a poll on my radio show recently, and more than 70 per cent of those who voted believe Manchester United will win the title next season. Is it heart ruling the head among the United faithful? Or is there a genuine belief that serial winner Louis van Gaal is about to re-assert himself at the very top again? Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Van Gaal poses for pictures with United fans at the training ground during a day for the club's foundation . Van Gaal (pictured talking to fans) is starting to assert himself at the United after a stuttering start . If he is to take United back to the very top, he’ll need more than Memphis Depay. I’ve already established in this column recently that Van Gaal is a great, and he is a winner. I love the fact he has set himself this huge challenge of resurrecting a fallen giant at the end of his career. The Dutchman knows, however, he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by David Moyes. At the end of his (albeit shorter) Old Trafford stay, his record will need to stand comparison with that of Sir Alex Ferguson. Obviously Van Gaal cannot win the same number of trophies Sir Alex picked up during his 27 year reign, so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at United? Sir Alex underachieved in Europe: only two Champions League wins in his time – just one more than Liverpool in the same period, and the same number as Jose Mourinho (who won those in significantly fewer years). Van Gaal has also underachieved in this department – his only Champions League win was with Ajax, not Bayern Munich or Barcelona. Van Gaal will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago. He should target Euro success as soon as possible. Domestically, United still don’t quite look like the finished article, despite their impressive run in 2015. But they should at least be challenging for the title next season. So what needs to change for United to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the Premier League and the Champions League? Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates his second Champions League triumph with United in 2008 . Van Gaal celebrates winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in Europe . Keeping David de Gea would be ideal, but Victor Valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former Barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the Nou Camp. Van Gaal blooded Valdes and then man-managed him superbly. Either keeper is fine, it’s obvious who would be preferred though. United need a quality right back – Nathaniel Clyne has been linked and the Southampton man would be perfect. If Clyne is the right fit, Luke Shaw needs to stay fit. He’s been like a rabbit in the headlights this first season, but he’s dealt with Van Gaal’s brutally honest management style well and put in a fine performance at Chelsea. I’ve said before, Shaw has the potential to be an all-time great at United. At centre half, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling might become the trusted partnership, or wisdom may win the day and United could go and get Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund. He’s a winner and a leader – perfect for United. Luke Shaw (right) has had a difficult start to his United career but impressed against Chelsea . Mats Hummels (left) of Dortmund is a player who has long been linked with a move to United . In midfield, United are strong in my view – Daley Blind and Michael Carrick can fight for that anchor spot, or even play together depending on the opposition. I can’t help thinking that adding another Carrick-type player to the squad might be a wise move for Van Gaal. United fans are seeing the best of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini in this current period, while Juan Mata and Ashley Young have been big positives this season. Wayne Rooney’s quality and contribution as United captain is never up for debate – for me he should be the closest challenger to Eden Hazard for Player of the Year. Which leaves players like Adnan Januzaj, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria. Ander Hererra (holding off Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas) has impressed for United in recent weeks . Juan Mata (right) is starting to show his best form after moving from Chelsea last January . Angel di Maria (centre) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for United . United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer . Januzaj has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene, but he may yet come good. Van Persie would be brilliant off the bench next season – he’s still capable of scoring important goals. The two South Americans are expensive stellar players, but neither have impressed in their first season in English football. To let both leave would be a gamble – European rivals will pick them up, and if they suddenly re-discover their game, United will look foolish. Keeping both is also a risk, but one worth taking if you add one more world-class attacking player. And that’s why United need to go all out to get Gareth Bale. At times this season United have been so slow in their build up. Bale brings dynamism, goals and energy to a side. He could flourish at United, stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo’s shadow at Real Madrid. United have already enquired about PSV’s Depay, he has all the skills and end product to be loved at Old Trafford, but United still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad. Memphis Depay (left, in action for PSV) is a prime target for United and has the potential to be a great signing . Gareth Bale has the dynamism, goals and energy that United have missed in their side this season . Van Gaal signed a three-year deal. If he wins the Premier League and the Champions League in that time he will be considered a total success at United. It’s a tough ask, but he could win both next season. Given his record of winning titles elsewhere, I certainly wouldn’t rule that out. I suspect the United haters will have to calm themselves down over the next few seasons. Did they really think United would be gone for long?","Man United have shown great promise for the future in recent matches .

The clip shows a large croc calmly moving through the marina in the tourist hotspot of Puerto Vallarta, in Mexico, with a black dog wearing a red collar lifeless in its mouth. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages, not moving at all'. Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop's owner. Scroll down for video . The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina, in Mexico . 'There's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river (200m away) which runs out to the sea and the marina,' Mr Weston explained. 'The dog went to the water's edge to see the crocodile (being curious I guess) but things didn't go according to plan obviously. 'It was certainly a shock to the system. Guess that's nature though,' he said. In the video the beast glides through the water, with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other, as crowds gasp in amazement.

One woman  called the video 'horrible' and another said 'I hate crocodiles now'. But crocodiles are a common site in Puerto Vallarta as the Mexican beach resort is built amongst the mangroves that the creatures have called home for centuries. As well as living in the nearby sanctuary, crocs are regularly spotted on the resort's golf course. In Mexico the 'American Crocodiles' can reach lengths of 6 meters and as a result of urbanisation are living closer to humans than ever before.

The 21-year-old all-rounder, who has yet to make his first-team debut for the Red Rose, plundered 34 fours and 27 sixes in his remarkable 138-ball innings. Lancashire believes the innings is the highest-ever individual score in a one-day match. Achievement: Livingstone came in at number 3 and smashed a triple-century as the scoreboard shows . Lancashire's Liam Livingstone hit 350 for Mantwich Town against Caldy in what could be a world record . He told BBC Sport: 'From 100 onwards, I was just trying to whack every ball for six.

45,"David Silva declared himself fit on Sunday night despite fears he had fractured his cheekbone after being caught in the face by Cheikhou Kouyate’s elbow. The Manchester City star was carried off in the win over West Ham following eight minutes of treatment on the pitch, where he was given oxygen. He went to hospital as a precaution but later posted on social media to ease fans’ worries, and the club announced on Monday that tests showed no fracture. David Silva (left) receives an elbow to the face by the on-rushing Cheikhou Kouyate in the second half . The Spaniard was caught right on the cheekbone and has been taken to hospital to be assessed . Silva turns around in pain before receiving several minutes treatment and being given oxygen . ‘Many thanks to all the messages of support, all the tests have gone well and I’m already home. The three points is what was important!’ he tweeted. Kouyate was only booked by referee Anthony Taylor and City boss Manuel Pellegrini believes the Senegal midfielder did not mean to injure his player. ‘I always think that a player doesn’t want to damage another player,’ he said. ‘The referee was so near and he decided it was unintentional. ‘He decides what happens and gave a yellow card. I hope that it was an accidental collision. ‘At this moment Silva is in hospital and they are checking if he has a broken bone in his cheek. It looked serious but we must wait for what happens at the hospital.’ Asked if Silva has been knocked unconscious, Pellegrini added: ‘I don’t know. The doctor has some doubts about that. After that he recovers well so we are checking.’ West Ham manager Sam Allardyce claimed that the incident was ‘accidental’, saying: ‘It was innocuous. I didn’t think it was a foul. ‘Everybody thinks it is more serious attack from Cheikhou than it was. ‘It wasn’t deliberate at all. He has no idea, it has happened from behind him. I have seen the reaction from the video on the laptop.’ Silva was given put in a neck brace and given oxygen as his concerned team-mates looked on . City bounced back from their defeat in the Manchester derby to win 2-0 through James Collins’s own-goal and Sergio Aguero’s 20th Premier League strike of the season. Pellegrini’s side are now one point behind third-placed Manchester United, who lost at leaders Chelsea on Saturday, in the race for a top-four finish and seven clear of Liverpool in fifth. ‘I think it was very important for our team to win,’ said the City boss. ‘We were coming from two defeats in a row, and always when one is a derby it is worse.’ After seeing the Hammers fail to win for the 10th time in 11 games, Allardyce said: ‘The most disappointing thing was the goals we gifted City. The two mistakes we make for the goals, one was pretty bizarre and the other unexpected from a player as experienced as Stewart Downing.’ The loss of Silva will be a big blow to Manchester City if his facial injury is as serious as first feared . Silva was taken off on a stretcher before being rushed to hospital as Manuel Pellegrini has a nervous wait . Jamie Carragher believes the FA have no option but to look into the incident. 'I think they will look at it. It's one of those where no one knows but him if he meant to do it. It was like when Costa stamped on Skrtel. 'Nobody can say 100 per cent, only he knows but you know as players, there are certain challenges or when you're running past someone you think - I can get away with this. 'I think he's gone past and gone I'll leave one on Silva and I'll put my hands up like I never meant it. You couldn't prove it but it doesn't look good and should have been a red card.'","Manchester City defeated West Ham 2-1 in their Premier League clash .

46,"On the eve of the County Championship season, Charlie Hemphrey has finally secured the professional cricket contract he has been striving for over the past decade. Only it is not with one of the 18 teams that make up our domestic game. For Hemphrey, a 25-year-old former Folkestone grammar school pupil who suffered habitual rejection in his attempts to breakthrough into the English system, has an amazing story to tell, after forging an unlikely first-class career in Australia. It has been an extraordinary journey for Hemphrey from a second XI debut for Kent at 15 to his recent status as the first Englishman to hit a Sheffield Shield hundred since John Hampshire for Tasmania in 1978. That feat was accomplished in Queensland's final match of the 2014-15 season, a victory over South Australia at the Gabba. Charlie Hemphrey during his Kent career (left) and as a youngster for Notts under 11s where he scored his first hundred (right) When he emigrated to Brisbane 18 months ago, he admits his desire for a shot at the top level had regressed into an 'unrealistic dream'. That it became a reality was due to polar opposite experiences to the ones he endured over here. Every time he was faced with a door it opened whereas previously they had slammed in his face. Kent, Derbyshire and Essex all knocked him back. A stunning first season down under – in which he finished third top scorer in Queensland's grade competition – was followed by a state second XI debut last October. The following month he struck 140 out of 297 all out in the first innings of a game against New South Wales. It put him in the frame for higher honours when the Shield season reopened post-Big Bash and a new year injury to Australia batsman Usman Khawaja gave him his chance. On February 7 he pulled on the maroon cap for the first time. James Pattinson dismissed him for a second-ball duck but Queensland – showing numerous changes in the wake of Stuart Law's removal as coach – crushed eventual champions Victoria by an innings. The following week Hemphrey hit 58 and Tasmania were defeated in Hobart by a similar scoreline. Two matches, two victories; the Pom had hit the jackpot. Queensland were not going to change a winning side and that very fact secured his future. Matches 5 . Innings 8 . Not Outs 0 . Runs 310 . Highest Innings Score 118 . Batting Average 38.75 . Balls Faced 809 . Batting Strike Rate 38.31 . 100s 1 . 50s 1 . 4s 37 . 6s 0 . 'The system over here guarantees you a minimum contract if you play three state games,' Hemphrey explained to Sportsmail. 'Cricket Australia upgrade you to a 12-month deal which is about $60,000 (£30,000), so after three games I told work I was leaving. I knew I was going to be paid well and the match payments on top are good at just over $4,500 (£2300).' Hemphrey immediately gave up his early morning job for Virgin at Brisbane Airport, co-ordinating their aircraft loads out on the ramps in sweltering heat. A fortnight later, in his fifth appearance for Queensland, he struck 118 on his adopted home ground. The celebratory removal of his helmet and glance to the heavens at reaching three figures an acknowledgement of his late Belgian grandfather Jim Charlier, who while not a cricket aficionado had witnessed his lowest ebb six years earlier when he made 163 for Kent seconds against MCC Young Cricketers. 'I am not really an extrovert, I keep my emotions fairly intact but what happened when I was released from Kent came back to me. A week after basically being told that I wasn't good enough my granddad came to watch and it was great afterwards listening to him talk about how I'd played from his non-cricket perspective,' Hemphrey explained. 'He passed away last year and so when I got to 100 I looked up and thought about him. I knew how proud he would have been. To me, scoring a first-class hundred in Australia is quite something but he taught me a lot about life, and I have to say I was a lot more nervous when I stood up to speak at his funeral than I was when I was on 97.' Although raised in Kent, Hemphrey was born in Doncaster and Geoffrey Boycott, arguably the greatest Yorkshire batsman of them all, would have doffed his cap at the price he places on his wicket. According to Hemphrey, a combination of leaving outside off-stump and playing the ball late is his modus operandi. 'The one thing I have learned over here is that the best time to bat is in the second half of the day, so getting through the first half has been important. Then I have cashed in.' Hemphrey's rise is all the more remarkable given that the three counties in his first incarnation as a cricketer were at least as interested in his off-spin (he has not bowled this past winter due to a labral tear in his shoulder). At Canterbury, it meant the presence of James Tredwell blocked his path. Although the three South Africans and two Pakistanis in a Kent side that made consecutive Twenty20 finals days in 2008 and 2009, when he held two summer contracts, were probably more to blame for his lack of opportunities. 'The club had other priorities, there was little focus on the second XI,' he says. In contrast, his performances were catching the eyes of Justin Sterns and Trevor Hohns - state coach and convenor of selectors respectively - not long after Australia Twenty20 international Chris Lynn, with whom a friendship developed during a previous three-year stint in Queensland grade cricket, lured him to Toombul. Naturally, there is a tinge of bitterness that his break has come on the other side of the globe: 'I just feel that you can't decide someone's career at the age of 19. It's too early. Different people develop at different rates. Look at Ryan Harris, Nathan Lyon, Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen. Those four all hit their prime in their late twenties.' Not that he completely rules out a return: 'I don't want to close any doors. I am open to anything and at the end of the day cricket is a very short career in the grad scheme of things.' But for now he is running with the Bulls as English cricket's unsung export.","Charlie Hemphrey fulfilled an 'unrealistic dream' to become a first-class cricketer .

48,"Andres Iniesta concedes that he has been unhappy with his form for Barcelona this season, despite receiving praise for his role in killing off Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League this week. The Spaniard played a pivotal part in setting up Neymar for the opening goal in the Catalan club's 2-0 second-leg win over PSG on Tuesday night at the Camp Nou, running from his own half before laying the ball on a plate for the Brazilian forward. Iniesta was typically modest about his fourth assist in Europe this season, preferring to focus on what has been a disappointing domestic campaign for the World Cup winner, in which he is yet to score or create a goal.

Paul Warren Smith, 61, was identified as the man in a white Marshall Independent School District van seen in surveillance video tossing five, 3-week-old puppies over a chain-link fence just before noon on Saturday at the The Humane Society of Harrison County's The Pet Place in Marshall. 'It appears the man was trying to do the right thing, of getting the animals to the proper place to take care of them,' Captain John Best with the Marshall Police Department told  KSLA. 'But the manner he went about it was wrong.' Scroll down for video . Charges: Paul Warren Smith, 61 (photographed), is facing an animal cruelty charge after police say he was caught on tape tossing five puppies over a six-foot fence at the Humane Society on Saturday . Uninjured: All five puppies are healthy and uninjured; each will be put up for adoption when they are at least 8 weeks old . In the video, the man is seen pulling the five puppies from a cardboard box recovered from the back of the van and flinging them over the fence in a manner that makes it unlikely that they landed on their feet. 'Luckily he didn't break their legs, or concussion, break a neck,' Kay Hill, director for The Pet Place, told KSLA. Hill said all five of the puppies are healthy and were not injured. Although the puppies are not available for adoption for another month -- when they are 8 weeks old -- the Society is taking applications for the pups. Van: In the video, the man is seen pulling the five puppies from a cardboard box recovered from the back of the van . Flinging: Smith is seen in the video  flinging a puppy over the fence in a manner that makes it unlikely that the pup landed on its feet . Smith, an employee of the MISD, has been placed on administrative leave.and the district issued a statement announcing the status of Smith's employment. 'MISD officials are aware of the incident. MISD will provide full cooperation with the Marshall Police Department,' the district said in a statement. Hill posted the surveillance video to Facebook with hopes that someone would be able to identify the man. A commenter quickly identified the man as Smith, an MISD maintenance worker, KSLA reports. Discovered: A Humane Society employee discovered four of the puppies in the yard Saturday afternoon and the fifth Monday after review of the tape showed five of the puppies being dropped into the yard . Thunderstorms: The fifth was found underneath a porch, most likely seeking shelter from the weekend's thunderstorms . Labrador: The puppies, which all appear to be a Labrador mix, are in the care of a Marshall High School employee . Smith was taken into custody Monday morning after speaking with investigators. He has since been taken to the Harrison County Jail and charged with cruelty to animals. A Humane Society employee discovered four of the puppies in the yard Saturday afternoon and the fifth Monday after review of the tape showed five of the puppies being dropped into the yard, NBC reports. The fifth was found underneath a porch, most likely seeking shelter from the weekend's thunderstorms. The puppies, which all appear to be a Labrador mix, are in the care of a Marshall High School employee. 'Everybody should learn from this video that this is not acceptable in Marshall, or Shreveport, or Longview, Dallas, or Houston, wherever you are,' Hill said.

50,"The TV channel E4 will shut down for 12 hours on the day of the general election to encourage more youngsters to vote. Cult US sitcoms like The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother will be taken off air for 12 hours – with viewers tuning in on 7 May shown instead an advert telling people to go to the polls. The specially-produced advert will be played, featuring 'Darren' – the man fictionally in charge of keeping E4 on air, sitting in the channel's control room. Scroll down for video . A specially-produced advert will be played on E4 on May 7 featuring 'Darren' – the man fictionally in charge of keeping the programme on air . The radical move could have a significant impact on the election with the advert set to be seen by millions of potential voters. E4 is the most popular channel for younger viewers, reaching 8.7 million 16-34 year olds every month – ahead of BBC2 and Channel 5. Its regular schedule will be suspended from 7am, when polls open, to 7pm, three hours before polling closes, when the channel will return to normal with Hollyoaks. Dan Brooke, Channel 4's chief marketing officer said: 'Less than half of under-25s voted at the last election so we've engaged the most powerful weapon that we have at our disposal to try and boost that number - switching off their favourite TV channel for the day.' E4's sister station Channel 4 will also run a special advertising campaign encouraging youngsters to vote. Voters aged between 18-24 and 25-34 are by far the least likely to take part in elections, prompting fears that politicians have given up trying to appeal to their concerns . The adverts will ask viewers: 'How many times have you missed life-changing events because you wanted to watch your favourite show? 'May 7 is election day and Darren is going to turn E4 off so you might as well go and vote. You won't forget will you Darren?' But viewers will only be able to take advantage of the TV switch-off if they have already registered to vote – with the deadline having already passed. Meanwhile, Channel 4 will present an 'alternative' to the election night coverage on the BBC and ITV, with a programme co-anchored by Jeremy Paxman and comedian David Mitchell. Paxman, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last June, said: 'Elections matter. But that doesn't mean the coverage has to be dull. I hope there'll be room for both insight and laughter.' The election-day shut down on E4 will see programmes including 'How I Met Your Mother' (pictured) taken off air for 12 hours . Fans of the US sitcom The Big Bang Theory will also be hit by the E4 decision to switch off its coverage between 7am and 7pm . Mitchell added: 'Our aim is to keep people watching much later than they intended and we will be judged by the dip in the nation's productivity on Friday 8 May.' The show will also include special election-themed episodes of Gogglebox and The Last Leg. The BBC's coverage of the election will be anchored by David Dimbleby, while Tom Bradby presides over ITV's election show and Adam Boulton anchors Sky's coverage.","Cult US shows like The Big Bang Theory  will be axed for 12 hours on May 7 .

51,"(CNN)The United States is urging China to release five young feminists who face years in prison over their campaign for gender equality. Authorities detained the women in three cities -- Beijing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou -- a few days ahead of events planned for International Women's Day on March 8. ""Each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Friday. ""We strongly support the efforts of these activists to make progress on these challenging issues, and we believe that Chinese authorities should also support them, not silence them."" The detention of Wei Tingting, along with Wu Rongrong, Li Tingting, Wang Man and Zheng Churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community. Protesters in several cities have called for their release and taken to social media with the phrase ""free the five"" as a hashtag. Wang Qiushi, the lawyer for Wei, said police recommended Monday that prosecutors press charges of ""assembling a crowd to disturb public order."" Prosecutors have seven days -- until Monday --  to decide whether to pursue the charges, according to the lawyer. ""We can do nothing but wait,"" Wang said. The five were initially held on suspicion of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble."" Wang said he didn't know why the charge against the women changed. ""Neither should constitute a crime,"" he said. Campaign group Amnesty International said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum prison term of five years. ""The women were doing nothing wrong, nothing illegal. They were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment,"" said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International. Wang said that Wei was subjected to lengthy cross examinations during her detention. Two of the women are said to be in poor health. He added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for International Women's Day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence. The five are members of China's Women's Rights Action Group. They had planned to hand out stickers with slogans saying ""stop sexual harassment, let us stay safe"" and ""go police, go arrest those who committed sexual harassment!"" on International Women's Day. This week, Kerry's predecessor, Hillary Clinton, tweeted that the activists' detention was ""inexcusable."" Chinese authorities rebuked her comment, saying public figures should respect the nation's sovereignty and independence.

52,"James Staring, a London-based personal trainer, says there are four simple ways to banish belly fat . Many of us dream of a flat stomach and washboard abs. But despite dieting and exercising,  fat around the middle can be especially hard to shift. Now, personal trainer James Staring, from Fit to Last, a London-based fitness company, claims he has four simple tips which can help anyone achieve an enviable stomach area. From writing a food diary to doing short burst of tough exercise, he reveals the best ways to burn away belly fat... Avoid white bread and pasta and only eat carbohydrates after exercise . Avoid carbohydrates that are refined i.e. white bread and pasta as these enter your blood stream much faster. They are also absorbed very quickly, and cause an insulin spike followed by a dip in energy. Unprocessed carbohydrates (i.e. whole grains, legumes, vegetables and fruits) increase feelings of feeling full and release sugar into the blood stream at a much slower rate. This stabilises blood sugar level, so you don’t get peaks and troughs, and your body composition will likewise remain stable. According to Dr. John Berardi from Precision Nutrition, your body is more capable of processing carbohydrates directly after exercise – so this is the best time to eat them. HOW THIS WILL HELP YOU: When you consume excess carbohydrate (and, by extension, if your carbohydrate consumption isn’t paired with activity) these carbohydrates are stored for future use, often as body fat. Do full body exercises . The more muscle groups you use, the more calories you will burn both during and after exercising. By doing complex movements (i.e. chin-ups) as opposed to isolation movements (i.e. bicep curls) you are using more of your body at once, therefore requiring more energy. You will burn more calories after exercise due to EPOC (Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption). When you start exercising your body goes from rest to increased metabolic activity, thereby requiring more oxygen. Carrying out full body exercises will speed up metabolism and means a person will burn more calories afterwards. This will assist in losing inches around the middle . Your body’s delay in responding to this increased oxygen requirement causes ‘oxygen debt’. When you finish an exercise session your body ‘pays back’ this oxygen debt through EPOC. Your body needs to consume more oxygen to replenish energy and nutrients, causing more calories to be burned. HOW THIS WILL HELP YOU: EPOC has the additional benefit of increasing your daily energy expenditure as well as your metabolism, turning your body into a calorie-burning furnace, which will assist in losing those inches around the middle. Do short bursts of high intensity exercise . The most common excuse for not exercising is lack of time. But if you want to lose belly fat, you must exercise, full stop. Doing short bursts of high intensity exercise leads to higher energy demands and more calories burned, which will help shed weight from the stomach . According to a study from Canada’s McMaster University, high intensity interval training (short blasts of exercise followed by short recovery periods) enables you to achieve the same exercise benefits in less time than slogging countless hours on the treadmill. Therefore, you can actually accomplish more by exercising less. HOW THIS WILL HELP YOU: High intensity interval training will create a positive knock on effect in terms of EPOC, leading to higher energy demands for recovery and more calories burned for longer. Write down what you eat (including how you feel two hours afterwards) Writing down how different foods affect feelings can stop a person mindlessly eating, Mr Staring claims . Busy lifestyles often mean that eating has become a required reflex, not a considered decision. To get a sense of what you are consuming and how it is affecting you, try the following for 30 days… . 1. Try on an outfit that currently doesn’t fit – take a selfie wearing this outfit. 2. Start writing down everything you eat, and the time you eat it, in a dedicated notepad. Be diligent and keep this up for 30 days. 3. When you finish each meal, set your phone alarm for two hours later, then ask yourself . 4. Record the results based on the following criteria: . 5. In 30 days, take the selfie again. HOW THIS WILL HELP YOU: Watching your energy level patterns is an effective way to monitor your blood sugar levels. Keep these levels consistent with carbohydrate timing, add in high intensity exercise, and the belly fat you want to be rid of will be a distant memory sooner than you think.","Personal trainer James Staring advises  how to achieve a flat stomach .

53,"Nigella Lawson is returning to the BBC to host a show about 'back to basics' cooking for the first time since the explosive court case involving her ex-husband Charles Saatchi. The celebrity chef, who last appeared on the channel with Nigellissima in 2012, will present Simply Nigella on BBC 2, a series which focus on 'a new pared-down approach to cooking and eating'. The show will mark Nigella's first solo venture with the broadcaster since the breakdown of her marriage to Mr Saatchi and the subsequent court case, in which she was forced to divulge details of the pair's tumultuous relationship and her own past drug use. Scroll down for video . Nigella Lawson is returning to the BBC for the first time in three years with a new series 'Simply Nigella' She briefly appeared on screen in the U.S as co-presenter for Taste but was stopped from flying to the country after confessing to taking cocaine during that case. The cook, who has famously fronted shows about cooking decadently, said the new show would be about 'food that makes our life easier, that makes us feel better, more alive and less stressed'. It is said to be focussing on 'healthy everyday breakfasts and substantial weekend brunches', as well as 'quick-to-make, lighter suppers that de-stress'. Nigella was at the centre of a very public court case in 2013, after she and Mr Saatchi accused their former assistants of spending £685,000 on credit cards given to them for work purposes. Months earlier, the couple's marriage had come to an abrupt end after Mr Saatchi was pictured with his hand on his wife's throat in a central London restaurant. But Lisa and Francesca Grillo were acquitted of fraud by a jury. It came despite the fact that Francesca, 35, had used her family card to spend £8,000 on designer clothes in a single day. The show will see the celebrity chef focus on 'a new pared-down approach to cooking and eating'. Pictured: Nigella in the premiere of Taste, a show she co-hosted in the U.S (left) and arriving at Isleworth Crown Court in 2013 (right) before giving evidence in the fraud trial of her two assistants . It will be the first time Nigella has appeared on the BBC since the breakdown of her marriage to Charles Saatchi (with whom she is pictured) and the explosive fraud case that followed . Their defence, which involved lurid drug allegations against their former boss, was that the TV cook let them spend whatever they liked providing they kept quiet about her cocaine and cannabis use. The court case also heard Miss Lawson describe her ex-husband as a 'brilliant but brutal man' who grabbed her throat out of jealousy when she idly wished for grandchildren. She claimed he drove her to drugs with his 'intimate terrorism'. Referring to details of her doomed marriage to Mr Saatchi being revealed in court, the 54-year-old said: 'To have not only your private life but distortions of your private life put on display is mortifying'. After their acquittal, the Italian sisters – dubbed 'the greedy Grillos' by the prosecution – said they had merely won their freedom, while Miss Lawson had established herself as a public favourite. Police said at the time they would not be taking any action after Ms Lawson's admission which came after the end of her marriage to Saatchi. The show will air in autumn this year. Nigella's return to BBC2 is just one of a number of new commissions for the station, which were unveiled today. Kim Shillinglaw, director of the station, revealed that at least eight new shows would be aired on the taxpayer-funded channel during the coming season. The Great British Pottery Throw Down, to be presented by Sara Cox, is among the new shows to air on the station and is being advertised as 'the Great British Bake Off's messier cousin'. Publicised with the tagline: 'It's messy, it's hot, it's pottery,' the show will see ten amateur potters thrash it out to try and win the 'master of the wheel' title. The Hairy Bikers have been asked to host a show which attempts to tackle the issues of an ageing nation . Other commissions include the move of popular show Family Guy to the channel, which will move over from BBC3. The Hairy Bikers have also been asked to host a show which attempts to tackle the issues of an ageing population in Old School by taking pensioners into classrooms to try and improve loneliness. Gareth Malone has also been brought back to the station for new show The Naked Choir, which will see him scour the country for would-be stars, and Hair - a show designed to find the country's best hairdresser - will also return for another series. Hugo Blick, who wrote The Honourable Woman and The Shadow Line, is also currently in the process of writing a new drama for BBC2 and BAFTA award-winning Stefan Golaszewski will bring a new comedy series called Mum. Daniel Radcliffe and Bill Paxton will star in new factual drama Gamechanger while a hard-hitting documentary series will follow Greater Manchester Police's new unit investigating sex offences. Gareth Malone (left) has been brought back to the station for new show The Naked Choir, which will see him scour the country for would-be stars, while Daniel Radcliffe (right) will star in new drama Gamechanger . Announcing the new commissions, Ms Shillinglaw said: 'BBC Two is in great shape. From the critical and ratings success of Wolf Hall, BBC Two's biggest drama series in at least 13 years and Banished, which was our fourth highest drama series launch, to stand out seasons on Food, The Super Rich And Us, Taking Liberties and our Holocaust Memorial content, we've got people talking and watching the channel in significant numbers. 'The sheer range and quality of content I'm announcing today demonstrates the unique role BBC Two plays in enhancing people's lives and contributing to the creative life of the UK. 'From enabling British writing, presenting and directing talent to do their most distinctive, signature work to Factual with real purpose that tackles contemporary issues in lively, intelligent ways or encourages viewers to take their passions further, I want BBC Two to be the place to come for widest range of grown up, opinionated and entertaining content on British television.'","Chef, who last appeared on BBC in 2012, will host Simply Nigella on BBC 2 .

54,"These dramatic images show the moment an Audi pulled out of a road and deliberately crashed into the side of a bus as part of a £1million 'crash for cash' scam. The elaborate fraud involved cars and vans being driven into the side of First Group buses so passengers - who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam - could falsely claim from insurers. The crashes took place between October 2010 and January 2012 and earned ringleader John Smith 45, from Connah's Quay, North Wales, £159,000. As the pictures show, all the collisions followed similar scenarios in which a car would collide with the side of a bus, causing both minimal impact and damage. In each case, the driver of the car would admit full liability, allowing all of the passengers from the bus to submit personal injury claims. Scroll down for video . The blue Audi pulls out from Whitchurch road, in Chester and accelerates into the side of the bus . It then collides into the bus as part of the £1million 'crash for cash' scam that took place over three years . The elaborate fraud allowed passengers on the bus, who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam, to falsely claim from insurers . Smith, the managing director of Swift Accident Solutions, stage-managed the crashes around the Chester area over the three-year period, in a bid to create new claimants for his business. He then personally processed 218 personal injury claims - which totalled more than £1million - to no win no fee lawyers. All of the bogus claims submitted by the Smith's company were for whiplash and 'soft tissue injuries,' meaning they could not be verified by the insurance companies. Instead, insurers were forced to rely on the individual claimants and usually settled out of court. John Smith (right), 45, from Connah's Quay, North Wales is facing jail after stage-managing several collisions in a £1m 'crash for cash' fraud; Luke McQuillan (left) was found guilty of of conspiracy to commit fraud . Police uncovered Smith's plot after being alerted by First Direct insurance to the unusually high volume of claims. They also found more than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another. The majority were friends or relatives of the 12 defendants, the court was told. The court heard how Smith had introduced 177 new claimants to a lawyer for which he received £960 each time. Investigators later found that the bogus claims accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total gross income at Swift Accident Solutions during the period. Smith was convicted yesterday at Manchester Crown Court Smith of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, following a 41-day trial. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud. Four more people had already pleaded guilty to the charge, while two defendants were found not guilty. Police believe more arrests will still be made over the scam. During the trial, the court was told how Smith masterminded the scam by finding drivers who were willing to carry out a fake crash. More than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another and were mainly said to be friends and relatives of the 12 defendants. Pictured: Richard Flynn (left) and Barry Cooper (right) were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud following the 41-day trial at Manchester Crown Court . The drivers would then pull out at low speed, using vehicles provided by Smith, and collide with the buses. The single and double decker buses had been chosen out of 'greed' because of the sheer number of claims that could be lodged, the court was told. Bus driver John Griffths told the court how he was caught up in one of the accidents while driving a park and ride bus towards Chester in June 2011. He told how he broke gently when he saw the Rover car pulling out of the side road, in a bid to prevent his standing passengers from being flung along the aisle. He added: 'I couldn't brake harshly because I had standing passengers, if I'd have done that they would have gone forward, so I had to go gently. The driver of the car said it was his fault, that his foot slipped off the brake on to the accelerator.' But he said one woman quickly reported that she 'wasn't feeling well'. He was also approached by three men, one of whom claimed he had hurt his leg on the bus steps, despite having no visible sign of injury. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud including Dean Brown, 42, (left) and Barry Cooper, 35 (right) When an ambulance was called to the scene, treatment was declined, he added. A passenger who was on the bus with his wife also told how he saw the Rover driver, at a side junction, actually looking at the bus just before to the collision. Although there was a 'minimal jolt', a fellow passenger was overheard exclaiming 'oh my back', he said. Smith was also accused of making a false representation by not declaring two outstanding county court judgments when applying for a licence to operate his claims management business. After the case Detective Inspector Simon Lonsdale from Chester CID said the force would continue to investigate the case. He said: 'This was an extremely complex investigation spanning nearly three years and involving a large number of defendants. 'It has been a challenging process for all officers involved and has required considerable professional skills in relation to the investigation and the subsequent prosecution. 'As part of our investigation conducted a significant number of interviews, to gather the required evidence to prove that Smith and his associates had stage these collisions for the sole purpose of financial gain. 'The crime that they committed was not a victimless crime, had all of the false claims created by Smith and his associates been successful we believe that the total cost would have been over £1 million, which would have been paid for by law abiding citizens through their car insurance policies.' Det Con Stephen Owens added: 'The Police have a duty to protect life, and although these collisions were all minor, they could have been much more serious. 'Yet despite the fact all of the collisions were minor, with minimal damage to both vehicles, they all resulted in multiple claims for personal injury claims, with the vast majority of these claims submitted via Smiths company. The trial at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard how the elaborate fraud involved cars and vans being deliberately driven into the side of buses so 'injured' passengers - who were mainly friends and relatives in on the scam - could falsely claim from insurers . 'Through our investigations and the evidence we have gathered, we have been able to identify a ""passenger Network"" which shows that a large proportion of the claimants can be linked to each other. This network proves that over 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions are linked to each other. 'Although the trial against these defendants has now concluded, we will continue to investigate this case and further arrests are likely.' Other defendants found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud were: Charlotte Watts, 28, from Wrexham; Daniel Shaw, 27, from Blacon, Chester; Dean Brown, 42, from Chester; Luke McQuillan, 40, from Blacon; Michael Gentile, 45, from Chester; Sean Kettyle, 43, from Ellesmere Port; Richard Flynn, 48, from Connah’s Quay; Andrew Shaw, 57, from Rodsham and Barry Cooper, 35, from Connah’s Quay. Cooper was found not guilty on one count of conspiracy. The following defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud before the trial: Howard Christopher Taylor, 36, of Seaforth; Christopher John Bethell, 30, of Eastham; Rachel Cooper, 32, of Great Sutton and Jason Power of Chester. David Clancy, 36, from Connah’s Quay and Jamie Stokes, 22, from Mold, were found not guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud.","'Crash for cash' fraud involved cars being deliberately driven into buses .

Ancelotti said: 'It is a subject that we will evaluate at the end of the season. What I can say is that I have liked his professionalism during the whole year.

56,"(CNN)Japan's space agency announced this week that the country would put an unmanned rover on the surface of the moon by 2018, joining an elite club of nations who have explored Earth's satellite. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), divulged the plan to an expert panel, including members of the cabinet and the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry on Monday. ""This is an initial step and a lot of procedures are still ahead before the plan is formally approved,"" a JAXA spokesperson told reporters. If it is approved, the agency will reportedly use its Epsilon solid-fuel rocket technology to carry and deploy a SLIM probe -- the acronym stands for ""Smart Lander for Investigating Moon"" -- on the surface of the celestial body. Japanese media estimates that the mission will cost in the region of ¥10 billion to ¥15 billion ($83.4 million - $125 million). JAXA spokesperson Chihito Onda confirmed to CNN that this estimate is realistic. The mission is expected to be used to perfect soft-landing technologies, which could be utilized in future, manned expeditions to the moon, or even Mars. The lander will use face recognition software found in digital cameras, which will be repurposed to enable the craft to recognize craters on the surface, Onda said. The move could be seen as Japan's attempt to play catchup to its Asian neighbors China and India, which have both notched significant extraterrestrial victories in recent years -- China's Yutu lunar rover outlasted expectations and India successfully put a probe into orbit around Mars the first time of asking. In 2008 Japan put its SELENE craft -- known in Japan as Kaguya, after a Japanese moon princess from a 10th century folk tale -- into orbit around the moon to gather data about its surface. The data gathered by the orbiter will also be used to calculate a suitable landing site for the rover. JAXA has also put a probe on an asteroid, which returned to Earth in 2010. Along with China, the United States and the former Soviet Union are the only other nations to have so far landed craft on the surface of the moon. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","Japan aims to put an unmanned rover on the surface of the moon by 2018 .

57,"The belief that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, a leading professor of psychiatry has claimed. David Healy, head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatric unit in Bangor, North Wales, said the misconception that low levels of serotonin were responsible for depression had become established fact. He suggested that the success of so-called SSRI drugs – which include Prozac and Seroxat – was based on the ‘marketing of a myth’. Scroll down for video . The idea that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, psychiatrist Professor David Healy argues. Pictured is Prozac, one commonly prescribed  SSRI . The emergence of these serotonin reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) drugs in the late 1980s came after concerns about tranquilliser use to treat depression. Even though they were weaker than old-style tricyclic antidepressants, they took off because of the idea that SSRIs restored serotonin levels to normal, ‘a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance’. In an editorial in the BMJ, Professor Healy said that in the 1990s, no one knew if SSRIs raised or lowered serotonin levels but there was no evidence that treatment corrected anything. He said: ‘For doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients. ‘For patients, the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser, especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness.’ However, other psychiatrists have refuted the professor’s claims, saying the profession has moved on from a simplistic description of the pills correcting a chemical imbalance. They warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’. Depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, argues one scientist. The condition could result from a parasitic, bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms, argues Dr. Turhan Canli, of Stony Brook University, U.S. If his theory is true, he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future. Writing in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Dr Canli said: 'It is time for an entirely different approach. 'Instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease. 'I propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.' Professor Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ‘That antidepressants are helpful in depression, together with psychological treatments, is established. How they do this is not. ‘Most researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model. ‘Most important of all, SSRIs are safer if taken in overdose than the older tricyclics. ‘People should not change their current medication on the basis of this editorial alone.’ NHS Choices, the website which advises patients, says: ‘It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms.’ Professor Healy’s editorial says it is important to raise questions about the drugs. He said: ‘In other areas of life the products we use, from computers to microwaves, improve year on year, but this is not the case for medicines, where this year’s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday’s models. ‘The emerging sciences of the brain offer enormous scope to deploy any amount of neurobabble. 'We need to understand the language we use. Until then, so long, and thanks for all the serotonin’, he concludes. Professor David Taylor, Director of Pharmacy and Pathology and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences Clinical Academic Group, King’s Health Partners, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Professor Healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which doesn’t and has never really existed: the idea that SSRIs ‘correct’ an ‘imbalance’ of serotonin in the brain. ‘Researchers and psychiatrists alike know that SSRIs are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work. Their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain. Other psychiatrists warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’ ‘Prof Healy fails to mention that SSRIs supplanted earlier tricyclics largely because of their relative safety in overdose, not because of any conspiracy concerning a theory of serotonin’s involvement in depression.’ Dr Paul Keedwell, Consultant Psychiatrist and Specialist in Mood Disorders, said: ‘In the real world of the clinic, SSRIs are undeniably effective in treating individuals with major depression. 'They have become the first line treatment of choice because they have fewer troublesome side-effects than their predecessors, and are safer in overdose. ‘David Healy has previously claimed that SSRIs cause dependence or provoke suicide. ‘In so doing he has risked deterring individuals with severe depression from getting the help they need and this latest article just adds to this problem. ‘The risk of suicide from untreated depression is much greater than the risk of treating it with antidepressants, and yes, this includes SSRIs.’","David Healy is head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatry unit in Bangor .

59,"Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp does not expect any particular reaction from his players or the fans to his announcement that he will be leaving the club in the summer. Klopp revealed on Wednesday that he will not be fulfilling the remainder of his contract, which was due to expire in 2018. Instead, he will be terminating his agreement with the Westphalians in the summer to seek a new challenge, but he has vowed to win as many games as he can before bringing his seven-year reign to an end. Jurgen Klopp (centre) speaks to Mats Hummels (left) during Borussia Dortmund's Thursday training session . The Borussia Dortmund coach leads the team's training session as they prepare for a German league match against Paderborn this weekend . And he expects the players to do the same, insisting they will be fully focused for Saturday's Bundesliga clash with Paderborn. 'We can draw strength from this story together,' Klopp said at Thursday's press conference. 'We've always been able to find reasons to do something quite special.' Klopp relayed the reactions of the players to his decision to the assembled press, saying: 'Nobody applauded me - so I guess that's a good thing. You need a moment to deal with such information, which is why I didn't really assess much of what happened in training (on Wednesday), but that's over now. Klopp announced his departure from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday after seven years . Klopp said he believed Dortmund needed a change of manager, but has urged his team to keep smiling . 'I want to see the players smiling, even if then somebody might write that the players are glad Klopp's leaving.' The fans will have had a few days to digest the news too, by the time Dortmund run out at the Westfalenstadion on Saturday, and Klopp expects the atmosphere to be no different to usual. 'If somebody feels they need to give me or my coaching team three cheers, then they would be wrong,' he added. Klopp has already been linked with a number of leading clubs around Europe . Klopp won the Bundesliga title twice during his seven years as Dortmund manager . 'I don't expect it and I don't need it. The important thing is that they get behind the team for 90 minutes.' Earlier on Thursday, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger refused to add to the speculation over whether Klopp's next assignment will be in the Barclays Premier League. Klopp insisted on Wednesday that he had had no contact with any clubs, but stressed he did not plan to take an extended time-out from the game. The German has been installed as favourite to replace the under-fire Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City, but Wenger was keen not to add fuel to the fire when quizzed on the matter. 'I'm not an agency to place managers and I like every manager and respect everybody, but I find that circus a bit ridiculous,' the Frenchman said. On whether Klopp would suit Arsenal, Wenger said: 'I already answered this question.' Wenger does not believe Dortmund players will necessarily look to follow the charismatic 47-year-old out of the Westfalenstadion. The emotion was clear to see as Klopp announced he was leaving the club at a Wednesday press conference . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger branded the 'circus' around Klopp's decision as 'ridiculous' 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund,' he said. 'Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, and has the ability to keep their best players. 'They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements, so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.' Klopp has enjoyed a hugely successful spell in charge of Dortmund since taking over in 2008, leading the club to two Bundesliga titles, DFB-Pokal success and the Champions League final. This season has been more of a struggle, with the club battling it out at the bottom end of the league for much of the campaign and currently sitting 10th. Asked about any advice he would give to foreign managers heading to the Premier League, Wenger replied: 'Try to get your ideas through and adapt as well to the local culture, and respect it.'","Jurgen Klopp announced that he will leave the club in the summer .

60,"Arsene Wenger is so respected and so clearly a deeply intelligent man that every now and then you find yourself nodding sagely at something he has said which, upon closer examination, turns out to sound right but to have decidedly unsubstantial foundations. Usually it is related to how Arsenal’s defensive record is statistically actually very good (it is) in the aftermath of the latest debacle. But last week it was on the issue of quotas, or more specifically FA chairman Greg Dyke’s idea of increasing the number of homegrown players in a Premier League squad of 25 from eight to 12. ‘I believe that we are in the world of competition,’ said Wenger in one of his regular interviews to beIN Sports. ‘That means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best or we are not in a competition anymore. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger shows his frustrations during a Premier League match in March 2011 . FA chairman Greg Dyke pictured attending the friendly between England and Italy in Turin on Tuesday . ‘So we can say one or two things – we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players. If you want to sell the Premier League for a huge amount of money then we need to say: ""Buy this, this is the best league in the world."" You cannot go against the quality and what is at the heart of our job, which is competition.’ And on the surface there seems nothing wrong with this. As an economics graduate Wenger is a disciple of Adam Smith and these are the basic principles of a free market. Tear down barriers, let competition flourish and the best man or woman will ultimately win – or at least have a place in Wenger’s starting XI. It sounds sensible enough but of course the issue is a little more complex than Wenger implies. A cursory glance at Wenger’s transfer record shows in his bid to save the Premier League from English mediocrity he has signed Tomas Danilevicius, Igor Stepanovs, Kaba Diawara, Sebastian Squillaci, Andre Santos, Amoury Bischoff, Park Chu-Young, Marouane Chamakh, Pascal Cygan, Philippe Senderos, Denilson, Manuel Almunia and Johan Djourou. Arsenal's Andre Santos on the ball during a league match against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in 2011 . Marouane Chamakh (left) attempts to control the ball during a Capital One Cup clash with Reading in 2012 . Arsenal midfielder Denilson (left) holds off Leyton Orient's Stephen Dawson at the Emirates in 2011 . There are more but that’s what a brief search elicits. You might argue that you need to sign ten Park Chu-youngs to get one Robin van Persie. And of course, over 18 years any manager, even a great one as Wenger is, can make some dud buys. He made some very good ones from abroad as well: Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Cesc Fabegas... we could go on. But the list of shame does expose a flaw at the heart of his argument. Clubs always argue for fewer restrictions and they always say it is to do with excellence. The reality is it’s just as much to do with cost. There is nothing in Greg Dyke’s proposals to stop Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla playing for Arsenal. It might however make it a little trickier for the likes of Almunia, Andre Santos and Stepanovs in the future. The reason why Arsenal went for Stepanovs back in 2000 was not because it he was excellent; it was because he was cheaper than the equivalent English player; same with Almunia in 2004 and Andre Santos in 2011. Turns out they weren’t good enough either. Arsenal's Park Chu-young in action during a Carling Cup match against Shrewsbury Town in 2011 . Igor Stepanovs (left) battles with Sunderland's Kevin Phillips for the ball at Highbury in December 2000 . Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia watches a shot go wide at the Emirates Stadium in January 2011 . Now it may be that applying more quotas could be detrimental to Dyke’s vision of encouraging clubs to play English players in that it pushes their price up even more. That’s a debate worth having but the main thrust of Dyke’s proposals is simply to encourage the clubs to rely less on the marketplace and grow their own players. For Wenger’s argument sounds great in theory but the reality is that there is a class of players at the tip of the footballers’ pyramid which stand out and which any team would want – the Thierry Henrys, Patrick Vierias of this world. Nothing in Dyke’s rules to prevent them from signing, as they were EU nationals. You would only have to be a little more sure you could find space for them as one of your 13 – that’s 13! – foreign players in your squad of 25. But there is another tier of players below that – let’s says the Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta level (who would also still be available under they Dyke proposals as EU players). These are good players, but they are much more plentiful than the elite. In fact, given the right training and a chance in the first team, you could probably produce your own. Arsenal did once: Ray Parlour. Served Wenger quite well, too, in his double-winning and Invincible years. Ray Parlour falls to the ground after a tackle by Tottenham's Jamie Redknapp at White Hart Lane in 2004 . Wenger (left) watches on from the touchline as Arsenal face Monaco in the Champions League last month . But Parlour was developed before Wenger arrived and he was the beneficiary of a youth system which was thriving at the time. The Arsenal manager, since his arrival, has never shown an awful amount of interest in Arsenal’s youth set-up. He is undoubtedly a manager who supports young players – it’s just most of them are signed from abroad or Southampton rather than coming from his own academy. The fact that Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere are regular starters and were players developed at Arsenal's academy during Wenger’s 18 years is exceptional for his period as manager. Ashley Cole was his greatest find from that source but who knows what would have happened to him had Silvinho not had to leave the club suddenly when his Portuguese nationality was called into question? All Dyke is trying to do is focus clubs and their managers on trying a little bit harder to look in their own backyard before spending £2million on Pascal Cygan. Nothing he has proposed would stop Premier League clubs from signing genuine superstars. The ‘best league in the world’ (the league, incidentally, without any qualifiers in the Champions League quarter-finals under the current policy) is under no threat whatsoever. Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs (left) breaks past QPR's Darnell Furlong at Loftus Road last month . Arsenal's Jack Wilshere (front) charges forward with the ball during a friendly against Brentford on Tuesday . Sadly Dyke probably killed his idea by announcing it in public before asking the clubs. If there is one thing guaranteed to rile the Premier League, it’s attempting to dictate terms. The only way to cajole the multi-national group of owners and executives into helping English football is by convincing them it’s in their own interests. Most are already on board in theory with the narrative that homegrown players are worthwhile. But now they need an additional nudge to take the final step and actually play some of their expensively-trained academy players. Even Mauricio Pochettino, who has a great track record with English players, wouldn’t have given Harry Kane a go if Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor had been producing. But if Kane isn’t a good enough incentive for the Premier League clubs to work harder to promote players, perhaps their recent travails in the Champions League and Europa League might convince them. A majority of the best players in the world are being produced in Spain and South America; another significant proportion come from Germany. Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor gestures during the Capital One Cup semi-final in January . Tottenham star Harry Kane celebrates after scoring against Leicester at White Hart Lane last month . The best of those players will naturally aspire to play for Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Now that Financial Fair Play restrictions mean the wages are no bigger over here, those that come to the Premier League will be the second tier of stars that can’t make it at those clubs. If English clubs want to be the best in the world, they’re going to have to become an awful lot better at creating the best players. And if Wenger wants to examine something truly mediocre he might wish to cast his eye over the Premier League’s record in Europe over the past three seasons. In fact, if he paid a little more attention to building a core of homegrown players then perhaps, like Ajax, AC Milan, Manchester United, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Arsenal might have won the Champions League by now.","FA chairman Greg Dyke wants to increase the minimum homegrown players in a Premier League squad of 25 from eight to 12 .

61,"The official word from Arsenal is that Jack Wilshere is not for sale at the end of the season. Not to Manchester City, not to anyone. Wilshere is one of Arsenal’s own, a product of the fabled Hale End academy and an example to young recruits that it is possible to make a first-team breakthrough. The reality is that Wilshere will sit with his influential father, Andy, at the end of the season to discuss whether a move to City would enhance his career and not just his bank balance. Jack Wilshere takes on Stoke's Charlie Ward during the Arsenal U21s game at the Emirates on Tuesday night . Wilshere was making his first appearance for the Gunners since recovering from ankle surgery . Wilshere has not featured for the first team since he was injured against Manchester United on November 22 . The England midfielder lays on the Old Trafford turf dejected after he suffered an ankle injury . Whatever manager Arsene Wenger has to say before Arsenal’s clash with Burnley on Saturday, Wilshere to Manchester City, as revealed in Sportsmail on Wednesday, is undoubtedly in the works. He is on the list of Txiki Begiristain, City’s director of football. At 23, he is a young English player who could bring down the average age of this City squad — if they could prise him from the Emirates. It will not be easy. Wilshere has always maintained that he wants to remain at Arsenal for the rest of his career. City, though, offer a fresh start and it is possible that Wilshere needs a change of environment after another frustrating season on the sidelines. England manager Roy Hodgson has preferred to deploy Wilshere in a defensive role for the national team . Manchester City have snapped up several players from Arsenal in recent times, with varying degrees of success. GAEL CLICHY . Transfer fee: £7m. Arsenal: 1 Premier League title (2003-04), 1 FA Cup (2005). Man City: 2 Premier League titles (2011-12, 13-14), 1 League Cup (2014). Verdict: Decent deal . KOLO TOURE . Fee: £15m. Arsenal: 1 Premier League title (2003-04), 2 FA Cups (2003, 2005). Man City: 1 Premier League title (2011-12), 1 FA Cup (2011). Verdict: Decent deal . EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR . Fee: £25m. Arsenal honours: none. Man City honours: none. Verdict: bad buy . SAMIR NASRI . Fee: £24m. Arsenal: none. Man City: 2 Premier League titles (2011-12, 2013-14), 1 League Cup (2014). Verdict: top transfer . BACARY SAGNA . Fee: free. Arsenal: 1 FA Cup (2014). Man City: none. Verdict: decent deal . It is also a well-trodden path for Arsenal players in recent seasons, with Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Bacary Sagna leaving the rhythmic, first-touch football at the Emirates for super-sized salaries at City. It is not an easy decision, particularly with the vulgar salaries on offer at the Etihad and the inevitable accusations of being a mercenary, but this is key moment in Wilshere’s career. The midfielder is already paid handsomely — £130,000 a week all in when he starts for Arsenal — but injuries are a constant source of frustration for Wilshere. He has not played a first-team game for Arsenal since November 22, when he was substituted 55 minutes into the 2-1 defeat by Manchester United at the Emirates with an ankle injury. In the past, Wilshere has been built up too soon, championed as a future Arsenal and England captain when he has yet to even make 100 starts for his club in the Barclays Premier League. Even former England captain Steven Gerrard claimed he had the ability to become one of the best midfielders in the world before he played Brazil at Wembley in February 2013. ‘Jack’s got a bit of everything. He can tackle, pass, get up and down the pitch, create a goal or score a goal,’ said Gerrard at the time. ‘He ticks almost every box, and he’s going to get better and better. He has the potential to become one of the best in the world. ‘I don’t want to put any pressure on him, but having played against him and seen him in training, he’s a one-off. He’s a lot better than your normal Premier League midfielder.’ The truth is that Wilshere needs time, room to breathe again after being championed ever since he scored that magnificent goal for Arsenal’s reserve team against West Ham at Barnet’s Underhill Stadium in 2008. Wenger was there that night, grinning with approval in the stands after the 16-year-old’s curling left-foot effort confirmed his status as one of the club’s rising stars. He earned instant comparison to Liam Brady. Gael Clichy (left) and Samir Nasri are just two Gunners who have left for Manchester City in recent seasons . Arsene Wenger's side are currently second in the Premier League and face Burnley on Saturday . Since then Wilshere has made the grade with the first team, an established member of a core group of players who are enjoying the club’s soothing possession football. On present form Arsenal are the best team to watch in the Premier League and Wilshere, recovering from his latest injury, would dearly love to be part of it. Although dad Andy is a West Ham fan, his son is Arsenal through and through, as he demonstrated after last season’s dramatic victory over Hull City in the FA Cup. During the victory parade, just hours before he joined up with the England squad to begin preparations for the World Cup in Brazil, he mischievously grabbed the microphone to ask the fans: ‘What do you think of Tottenham?’ The answer was well-publicised at the time, but the more pertinent question is whether Wilshere can reclaim his first place in this developing Arsenal team. Wilshere could struggle to break into a side containing Alexis Sanchez (left) and Mesut Ozil next season . With England, manager Roy Hodgson plays him at the base of his midfield diamond, but at Arsenal Wenger prefers him in a pairing behind the main attackers. With Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey the favoured attacking players behind Olivier Giroud, this is not an easy team for Wilshere to get into next season. At 23 he has time on his side and even at the end of this season there are still three years to run on his current contract. Soon enough there will be a decision to be made for all concerned.","Jack Wilshere has been linked with a move to Manchester City this summer .

62,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton finally answered the question we've all been asking for years: Will she run for president in 2016? With official news of her candidacy just hours old, one thing is already crystal clear: For the next year and a half, Clinton will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the United States. Win or lose, this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder. Just consider the two potential outcomes. A win would mean a woman in the White House, which is a vital step in the march toward women's full political inclusion. But it's possible that the march will end right there. We'll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we've come. We'll raise the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner over the women's movement. And we'll call it a day. Granted, 80% of elected officials throughout the country will still be men. Women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office. And pay inequities, sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve, no matter how hard Clinton might try. ""But we've elected a woman as president,"" we'll say. Let her take care of it. A loss would be even more difficult. Clinton will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is. More generally, her loss would perpetuate the myth that women cannot win big elections, that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination, and that women must be twice as good to get half as far. ""If Hillary Clinton can't win an election,"" potential female candidates will ask, ""How can I?"" Extrapolating from one female candidate's experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect. But in the case of Clinton, it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons. First, Clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate, if there is such a thing. She began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve, and she is even more well-known today. But that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well-publicized baggage. Voters, donors, journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of Clinton before she ever eats a corn dog in Iowa, steps onto a debate stage in New Hampshire or takes a shot of bourbon in Kentucky. Too often, we treat Clinton's loss to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power. In reality, what people knew about Hillary Clinton likely shaped their views of Hillary Clinton. Widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not. After all, for decades, women who have run for office have performed just as well as men. They win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money. Do some voters still question women's suitability as leaders? Of course they do. But these attitudes, which have become increasingly rare, do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates. Second, presidential politics is, first and foremost, a partisan affair. The D or R in front of the candidates' names -- not the X or Y chromosomes in their DNA -- tells us about how more than 90% of the population will vote. Party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case. Now, I'll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week, we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits, and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes, photos and captions that have taken hold on social media. The Clinton campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address, which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes. I don't want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate, disrespectful and appalling. And incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates won't need to consider. But men yelling ""Iron my shirt"" at a campaign rally, cable news pundits associating Clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing Hillary Clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections, partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know. If Clinton wins the race, it will be because it was a good year for Democrats. And if she loses, it will be because the GOP developed a winning message. But how much does any of this really matter? Sure, voters are amenable to electing women. Any Democratic nominee would face the same electoral landscape. The problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the White House. And inferring too much from Hillary Clinton's experiences is a risky endeavor. Yet the minute Clinton announced her candidacy, she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the United States. That's a label that no female candidate should have to wear. Let the burden begin.","Jennifer Lawless: There's a strong temptation to view Hillary Clinton's candidacy as all about cracking the glass ceiling for women .
She says the reality is that most people will vote not on gender but on the economy and partisanship ."

Amy Kight, Busch Wildlife Sanctuary's Animal Care Director, told WPTV: 'My first reaction was amazement that somebody actually took that picture because bobcats are generally very, very reclusive. 'You don't really see them out and about too often.' A spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has said she believes the image is genuine. FWC's Liz Barraco told WESH 'There is no reason to believe it's fake.' The bobcat exhibited typical behavior, FWC officials told the NBC affiliate station.

67,"A university student attacked by a serial rapist confronted him in court yesterday to say he had taken away ‘every piece of joy’ in her life. Jessica Howard, 23, denounced ‘night stalker’ Clive Howard, 57, for his string of assaults on six women over 28 years. She told him that the catastrophic impact of his attack could never be put into words and has destroyed her life. Clive Howard, 57, (left)  dubbed 'every woman's living nightmare', was today jailed for life and one of his victim's, Jessica Howard, 23, (right) who has bravely waived her right to anonymity . Waiving her right to anonymity, the student – who is not related to the rapist – said he had ‘humiliated’ her and ruined precious relationships with those closest to her. ‘You have made it impossible for me to enjoy moments of happiness. Your attack literally darkens every piece of joy I have,’ she told him. ‘Because of you, my body is now worthless to me. You took away all of my control, took away all meaning to my body other than an inanimate object with no worth.’ The dramatic confrontation came as Howard was jailed for a minimum of ten years and three months after admitting seven rapes, one attempted rape and three kidnappings. Described as ‘every woman’s living nightmare’, he prowled the streets of Cambridge and Norwich looking for victims. The mechanic, a father-of-six who lives with his parents in Battisford, Suffolk, picked up some in his Volvo estate and pounced on others in parks. Yesterday detectives revealed 15 other women have come forward since Howard appeared in court last year to say he also attacked them. Norwich Crown Court heard that Miss Howard was picked up by the rapist after a night out in Norwich last May. He drove her to an isolated car park and raped her. She managed to stagger away half-naked and was rescued by a taxi driver who drove her to a friend. Police discovered CCTV footage which captured images of his car after the attack and driving around Norwich city centre earlier in the evening. A CCTV image of Howard'scar as he prowled the streets of Norwich on the night he raped Jessica Howard . Howard (his car is seen far right in this CCTV) admitted seven counts of rape, three of kidnap and one of attempted rape at an earlier hearing . Separately, a DNA sample matched the unsolved case of a woman who was the victim of an attempted rape in Cambridge almost exactly one year earlier. The woman, aged in her 30s, managed to scratch Howard as she fought him off, trapping vital forensic evidence under her fingernails. It later emerged he had tried to force another woman into his car on the same night and two other women in the city three months earlier. As their investigation widened, police traced a woman who told them Howard had raped her at least six times in Suffolk, starting in 1986. Miss Howard, who is originally from Essex and is studying history of art and literature at the University of East Anglia, sat just yards from Howard as she addressed him. Reading an open letter, she said: ‘To describe the ramifications of you raping me is impossible. I cannot put the full extent into words. I trusted you to take me home. Still, I blame myself for being raped, for getting into your car. ‘I had to see my mother’s face as she looked at her only daughter after she had been violated in the worst possible way.’ The car park where Howard took Miss Howard to rape her after picking her up and offering her a lift home . Miss Howard was able to describe his Volvo (pictured) to police, who traced him to an address in Suffolk . She added: ‘On top of this you have ruined my relationships with friends and family. Friends who do not know how to react have removed themselves from my life. Some ignore it as if it doesn’t matter. ‘How am I supposed to enter into a happy relationship, to have a happy life with the stigma of what you have done tormenting me? How am I meant to have a family if I always remember what you did, the sickening belief still stirring in my stomach that it was my fault.’ Sentencing him, Judge Stephen Holt described Miss Howard’s statement as ‘heart-rending’ and said the ‘effect you had on her life is devastating’. He added: ‘This was a campaign of sexual offences for many years. You did severe psychological harm to your victims. Two describe you spanking them – this is additional humiliation and degradation. There was clearly a significant degree of planning and targeting.’ Outside court, Detective Sergeant Chris Burgess described Howard as a ‘dangerous predatory loner’ who frequented dating websites and used prostitutes. He said: ‘There is concern there are further victims out there and we would encourage anybody who believes they were attacked by him to come forward.’","Clive Howard, 57, preyed on lone women on Norfolk and Cambridge streets .

68,"A former Portuguese detective was today ordered to pay nearly £360,000 to Kate and Gerry McCann after a long-running libel trial. Goncalo Amaral had been on trial over claims he made in a book and a documentary that the couple were involved in their daughter Madeleine's disappearance. In a written verdict, a Lisbon court agreed that Amaral should pay Mr and Mrs McCann €250,000 (£179,000) each in damages and banned further sales of his book The Truth Of The Lie. The couple's lawyer Isabel Duarte also revealed that Amaral had been told to pay interest which she said stood at present at €106,000 (£76,000). Scroll down for video . Kate and Gerry McCann have reportedly been awarded £360,000 in damages from an ex-Portuguese detective who wrote a book claiming their daughter Madeleine had died in an accident instead of being abducted . Police chief Goncalo Amaral (above) ran the initial investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann . Madeleine was three when she went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Mr Amaral, who led the initial investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, released his book three days after the case was closed in 2008. He later took part in a documentary for Portuguese television in which he claimed that Madeleine was dead, that there had been no abduction and the McCanns had hidden her body. The couple, who accuse Amaral of hampering the search for their daughter, had been expected to receive around £1million in damages. Amaral's lawyers have leave to appeal the ruling. The McCanns told the court last summer they were left 'devastated and crushed' by his book, which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief. Mrs McCann, 47, said Madeleine's twin siblings Sean and Amelie, now ten, knew Mr Amaral had written a book but didn't know the detail. Amaral claimed Madeleine (above) had not been abducted, but had died in an accident in Praia da Luz . She told the court last July after applying to make a statement: 'I believe that's what's in Mr Amaral's book and the documentary is very distressing to adults. 'To a child, it could be very damaging.' Asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book, she said: 'I was devastated. 'It made me feel quite desperate because of the injustice I felt towards my daughter and our family as a whole. 'It was very painful to read and I felt sad for Madeleine. I also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage I felt it was doing in Portugal.' She went on to accuse Amaral, thrown off the investigation in 2007 for criticising British police, of 'consistently smearing' them. She also claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter's whereabouts. A team of 31 British detectives are working exclusively to find the girl. Mystery: British police shift through soil on an area of wasteland during a search for Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in June last year during their investigation into her disappearance . The Metropolitan Police was tasked with investigating the disappearance after her family made a personal plea to David Cameron in 2011. Since Madeleine vanished, every possible theory has been explored, including that she was kidnapped by a paedophile or killed during a botched burglary. Others include being snatched by traffickers and sold to a childless couple and that she wandered out of the apartment and died in a tragic accident. However, not one shred of proof of what happened to Madeleine has been uncovered. Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, who took over Operation Grange in December, and her team travelled to Portugal to interview seven suspects and four witnesses, but have not released any information about what they discovered. Portuguese prosecutors also reopened their probe into Madeleine's disappearance last year and are conducting a separate investigation to one led by Scotland Yard.","Goncalo Amaral claimed in book couple were involved in disappearance .

Coutinho starred for Liverpool in their 2-0 win against Newcastle United on Monday night and managed five shots against goalkeeper Tim Krul, though he could not nab himself a goal. Liverpool sold Suarez to Barcelona for £75million during the summer, but Carragher feels Coutinho can fill the sizable gap left by the controversial Uruguay striker. Philippe Coutinho is becoming Liverpool's go-to guy, according to Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher . Coutinho starred for Liverpool in their 2-0 win against Newcastle United on Monday night . Liverpool sold star striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million during the summer . 'The role he played tonight was the false nine we speak about a lot,' Carragher told Sky Sports after the Barclays Premier League match. 'We expect him in a wide area, but we saw some of his touches tonight and his ability in small spaces against players, some of the pieces of play he produced tonight. 'Last season Luis Suarez was Liverpool's main man, the go-to man. But as this season has progressed, and for the future, Coutinho is Liverpool's.' It was Coutinho who scored Liverpool's only goal against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the FA Cup last week to book their place in the semi-final.

70,"Philipp Lahm has given former Bayern Munich team-mate Owen Hargreaves an insight into the meticulous approach of  manager Pep Guardiola ahead of the club's Champions League quarter-final tie against Porto. The World Cup winner was speaking to the BT Sport pundit as part of a special documentary 'Inside Bayern Munich with Owen Hargreaves' which airs Saturday at 10pm on BT Sport 1. 'His tactical understanding is incredible,' Lahm explained. 'He always gives our team solutions to playing the opposition. VIDEO - Scroll down to see a preview from 'Inside Bayern Munich with Owen Hargreaves' Bayern Munich man Philipp Lahm (left) talks to former team-mate Owen Hargreaves about his career so far . Lahm (right) and Hargreaves played together at Bayern when Hargreaves was at the club from 2000-2007 . The former Bayern midfielder speaks with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the Bayern chairman . Lahm lifts the World Cup with Germany (left) and praised his Bayern manager Pep Guardiola (right) 'He prepares for every opposition completely differently. How flexible our team has become, with a back 3, back 4 or back 5.' Lahm  dissected the differences in approach between Guardiola and his predecessor, Jupp Heynckes, who masterminded a Bayern treble in 2013 before retiring from coaching. 'With Heynckes in 2013, in the big games we played quite defensive on the counter attack. Everybody worked together as a group, we invested a lot of energy in the games,' Lahm said. 'Now under Pep it's more tactical and we have more possession but not like previously when we had a lot of possession but we didn't have any clear scoring opportunities. 'The goal is to go forward and create scoring opportunities. To press very high. To win the ball back very quickly. But to do that you need a clear plan and the daily work on the pitch.' At the age of 31, Lahm is one of the most decorated and accomplished players in modern football. He already has six Bundesliga winners medals, with a seventh seeming certain to follow with Munich ten points ahead of Wolfsburg with six games remaining. Aside from a two-year loan spell at Stuttgart, Lahm has spent his entire career at Bayern but confessed to Hargreaves that he did not ever anticipate the success he has had. Jupp Heynckes led Bayern to a treble in 2013 before retiring from coaching, and was succeeded by Guardiola . Lahm celebrates winning the Bundesliga (left) and the Champions League in 2013 . 'I came at 12 in 1995 and everything's a dream,' Lahm said. 'It's a dream to become German champion, to become a German national player but that it all happened, German champion, Champions League winner, captain of the club, to play for the national team, it's not something that you can plan. 'Maybe eventually it becomes a goal but at the beginning, that's what it is, just a dream. 'For me this is my home. I'm born in Munich, I grew up here, I've been at Bayern Munich since I was 12 years old besides the two years in Stuttgart. 'I might have won the Champions' League earlier with another club but the value of winning the Champions League with my club is much more valuable.' Lahm has demonstrated a versatility both for Germany and Bayern that points to a heightened understanding of the game. He has played at right-back, left-back and as a defensive midfielder with club and country, leading to many earmarking him as a future Bayern manager. The idea is not one Lahm, who is contracted at the club until 2018, rejects but he is still focused on attaining more titles with as a player, starting Wednesday at Porto. Lahm (left) has played at Munich his whole career but had a two-year loan spell at Stuttgart . Lahm (right) is currently gearing up to take on Porto in the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday . Lahm (right) also spoke to Hargreaves about his career where he has won many trophies and become captain . 'It's nice that people talk about me in other positions at the club,' Lahm admitted. 'I've got another three years at the club, let's wait and see what happens then. 'Of course I can imagine myself staying here after I've finished playing, that goes without question.'

71,"(CNN)Recently, Robert Kennedy Jr. was in Sacramento, California, to campaign against Senate Bill 227, which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations. In his remarks at an anti-vaccination movie screening, he decided to compare ""vaccine-induced"" autism to the Holocaust. He said, ""They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,"" Kennedy said. ""This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country."" A few days later, he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the Holocaust. To many, it's sacrilege to compare any lesser issue to the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis. In a statement, Kennedy said, ""I want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic. I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism, which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families."" Robert Kennedy Jr. has apologized for the wrong things. First and foremost, vaccines do not cause autism. The two have nothing to do with each other. Second, he seems to think people with autism are ""gone,"" their lives ""destroyed"" and their families ""shattered."" Autism is not a death sentence. People with autism are not missing or destroyed. They are everywhere, trying to live their lives in a society that too often demeans them as subhuman, missing or worthless. Kennedy's rhetoric is a problem, even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines. People who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach-based enemas. Others, believing autism functions as a death sentence, even kill their children. I am worried about the effect of having such a powerful, high-profile member of our political class endorse this demeaning depiction of life with autism. I reached out to a number of autistic activists for comment. Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, wrote, ""Robert Kennedy Jr, who has engaged with autism only to spread lies, misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric, has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic Americans. While his father, uncle and many others in the Kennedy-Shriver family championed the rights of people with disabilities, he has instead cast his lot with those who use pseudo-science to question our humanity."" These are harsh words, but try to see the situation through Ne'eman's eyes. Not only is Kennedy perpetuating a discredited theory, but he's also suggesting that it's better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic. The usual response to people like Ne'eman is that he is ""high functioning,"" but what of the burden to families who are struggling to care for less able individuals? Henry Frost, an autistic teenager and writer, is devastated by this focus on burden. Last year, he wrote a post to other autistic children: ""Know you are not a burden or trouble for being. You are a person who has every right to be. A family that is saying love but saying you are so hard so wrong for not being as they wanted. The family is wrong. Not You."" Meanwhile, Amy Sequenzia, an autistic activist and blogger, wrote, ""I am very disabled, have most of the usual not autism but co-occurring conditions, seizures almost every day, but am happy, proud and accomplished, with the human supports I have. That's what is missing. Acceptance."" As children, Sequenzia and Frost might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as ""gone,"" by Kennedy. Clearly, both are very much present. The solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity. Michael S. Monje Jr., an autistic writer and editor with Autonomous Press, wrote, ""The neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude. It is a way for autistic people, as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology, to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that -- natural. The fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural, less worthy, or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world."" I wish Kennedy realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities, even as he defended the sacred status of the Holocaust. There is, though, one story from the Holocaust that he might do well to consider. The first group the Nazis systematically exterminated, in the infamous Action T4, were people with intellectual and other kinds of disabilities.  Thousands of children, adolescents and adults were sent to gas chambers, laying the groundwork for the later, larger scale acts of genocide. Underlying Action T4 was the belief that people with disabilities were devoid of value. We fight those beliefs by celebrating neurodiversity, not by fearmongering. Kennedy owes a lot of people another apology.","David Perry: Robert Kennedy Jr. compared autism to the Holocaust, wrongly tied it to vaccines .

72,"Alastair Campbell famously said the Blair government ‘didn't do God’. But David Cameron and wife Samantha have made a colourful visit to a Sikh temple as part of a general election tour. The Prime Minister, wearing a traditional orange patka, and Mrs Cameron, in a blue headscarf, chatted and posed for selfies at the Gravesend Gurdwara in Kent earlier today. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister and his wife joined worshippers at the Gravesend Gurdwara in Kent today in traditional Sikh dress . Mrs Cameron chatted with a young boy and his mother at the temple. The visit was designed to reach out to a wider community with just three weeks until the election . They briefly joined thousands of people in a parade carrying the Sikh holy book to the temple before Mr Cameron gave a speech. It comes just a day after the Conservative leader attended one of the largest gatherings of Christians in the UK. His speeches are designed to reach out to a wider community with just three weeks to go before voting. But as he was about to arrive at the temple today a senior priest apparently objected to prayers being interrupted. There were some heated scenes before the address was moved to a side room. The Tory leader told the audience the Vaisakhi festival, which is one of the most important events in the Sikh calendar, was a 'big, bold' sign of their devotion. He said: 'I wanted to make sure Downing Street was part of this too and I'm proud to be the first Prime Minister to host a Vaisakhi reception at Number 10.

CLAIM: Jesse Norman and the chocolate cake he allegedly gave out while campaigning for re-election . Police are investigating a Tory MP over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake. Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency. West Mercia Police last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which bans Election candidates from providing food, drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes. The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ COUNTRY LIFE: A 'beater' at work and below,  a bottle of Sipsmith Dry Gin . The Prime Minister indulged his love of country sports by taking part in a secret country shoot near his Oxfordshire constituency home. And he celebrated with a nip of a specially prepared ‘Chipping Norton’ cocktail. But witnesses say that David Cameron did not himself use a gun – despite his reputation as a skilled marksman. Instead, he acted as a ‘beater’ to flush out the game. The event took place on New Year’s Eve but until now has been kept a closely guarded secret. It took place near Chipping Norton, the Oxfordshire town which has given its name to the ‘Chipping Norton set’ of high-profile local residents from the world of politics, media and showbusiness such as Mr Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson. Last night, the man who served Mr Cameron the cocktail said other people on what he described as a ‘country walk’ had no idea there would be a VIP guest. Jared Brown, master distiller at the West London ‘artisanal’ gin company Sipsmith, said: ‘No one but the landowner knew the Prime Minister would be joining us.’ He fought shy of describing the event as a shoot, but added: ‘I can say with utter certainty that Mr Cameron did not handle a gun.’ Mr Brown confirmed, though, that the PM did sample the cocktail, based on Sipsmith London Dry Gin. Last night, the drink, also containing manuka honey, raspberry tea and extract of echinacea, was being dubbed the ‘Chipping Norton cocktail’.","David Cameron and wife Samantha made a visit to a temple in Kent .

74,"A 96-year-old paedophile became Britain's oldest prisoner after he was jailed for the historic sexual abuse of two young girls. Gaston Pinsard was sentenced to 18 months behind bars after he admitted carrying out the  assaults  more than 50 years ago. The 96-year-old, who claimed he was himself abused at a notorious Jersey children's home, first targeted his victims when they were just five-years-old. Frail Gaston Pinsard, 96, is thought to be Britain's oldest serving prison . A judge branded the historic case 'distressing' and 'unpleasant' as he jailed the frail father-of-four. Guernsey's Royal Court heard that Pinsard was born in 1919 and claimed he had endured years sexual abuse at the Haut de la Garenne children's home. The Jersey home came under intense scrutiny in 2008 after police took statements from 192 alleged victims of historic child abuse. Pinsard joined the army after leaving Haut de La Garenne, where he realised his sexual outlook and experiences were different to other peoples. The court heard he later indecently assaulted the two young girls through curiosity and naivety. The abuse began in 1951, and the court was told the victims did not report what was happening because they were too young to understand what was happening and that they trusted Mr Pinsard. He was first questioned by Guernsey Police officers last year and immediately confessed to carrying out the abuse over a nine year period. The court heard how Pinsard touched the first girl on numerous occasions between 1951 and 1955, and the second between 1964 and 1969 at his home in St Sampson, Guernsey. In a statement read out in court Mr Pinsard admitted he felt ashamed and knew at the time what he was doing was wrong but he could not control it. Pinsard was married with four children at the time of the offences, which took place over a period of nine years and only stopped when he decided to 'stop his filthy habit'. He explained to the court how he 'didn't want to hurt any children'. His wife has now passed away, but Pinsard was accompanied to court by his son. At an earlier hearing the defendant, who uses a hearing aid, admitted nine charges of indecent assault. The Haut de La Garenne children's home in Jersey, where the paedophile claims he was abused as a young boy . Pinsard's defence asked the court to exercise extreme caution, suggesting it would be difficult for the prison to accommodate his needs and medication. In sentencing, Judge Russell Finch acknowledged it was 'a difficult situation' and took his age and health into account, stating that a younger man would have received between seven and nine years. Accounting for the risk of the defendant becoming ill and dying in Prison, Mr Finch sentenced Pinsard to two 18-month sentences in Les Nicolles prison, which will run concurrently. The Prison Officers Association have said they believed Pinsard is the oldest serving prisoner in the British Isles.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini has been hampered over the past year by UEFA restricting them to a net transfer spend of £49million in each window and keeping the club’s overall wage bill to its current level of £205million-a-year. UEFA’s settlement with City published in May stated those penalties would remain in place until the end of the 2015/16 season but the club’s latest financial figures showed drastically-reduced losses of £23million which they feel proves they are now compliant with FPP regulations. Manuel Pellegrini is hoping that the financial restrictions imposed by UEFA for a breach of FFP rules will be lifted at the end of this season . Manchester City have been limited to a net spend of £49million in the last two transfer windows - they spent £25m bringing Wilfried Bony in from Swansea in January . Ahead of Monday night’s trip to Crystal Palace, Pellegrini was certainly talking like a man excited at the prospect of signing 'crack' players this summer. ‘I think that next season we don’t have any restrictions so we will be in the same position that all the other English clubs have,’ said Pellegrini. ‘It’s important. You have so many strong teams here in England and in Champions League, you can not allow them to keep the advantage every year; having less players to put in your squad or spending less money. We spend money, of course we always spend money, but they spent more.’ Manchester United, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal have all paid more in transfer fees in the past 12 months than City who were traditionally Europe’s biggest spenders after the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi owners in 2008. Uefa also ordered City to play with a reduced squad from 25 players to 21 in the Champions League this season and while that restriction has now ended, any time reduction in the penalties on spending and wages is more controversial. Arsenal have paid more in transfer fees than City in the last 12 months, including £30m on Alexis Sanchez . The document published last May by UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body investigative chamber explicitly said City’s financial penalties would run for two seasons at least and there has been no official deviation from that decision. The published statement said at the time: ‘Manchester City agrees to significantly limit spending in the transfer market for the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16. It means City will have to argue their case with Uefa that as they have been financially compliant over the past year, they deserve to be free of restrictions moving forward. They have successfully argued their case with UEFA before. Last summer they persuaded the governing body to allow them to bypass the normal quota of eight homegrown players as their Champions League squad had been reduced. Eliaquim Mangala joined the champions from Porto for £32m last summer . The reigning Premier League champions have only paid money for Fernando, Willie Caballero, Eliaquim Mangala and Wilfried Bony in the last two transfer windows and that was part-paid by the sales of Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell. Pellegrini admitted they weren’t in a position to compete with neighbours United for established world stars like Angel di Maria because of the FFP penalties. It has cost City on the pitch. Even if they win their remaining eight Premier League fixtures their points tally will be lower than last season and they crashed out once again at the last-16 stage of the Champions League. Pellegrini and director of football Txiki Begiristain both accept the squad needs replenishing and they want to be in the market for the top available players. Manchester City have been heavily linked with a move for former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne . The club also want to be involved in any race for Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling . They have been strongly linked with former Chelsea winger Kevin de Bruyne who has been one of the best players in the Bundesliga with Wolfsburg. And if Liverpool do allow Sterling to leave, City want to be involved in the chase for one of England’s most outstanding talents to help fit in with quotas for homegrown players. ‘If you are the manager or a player of a big tem, you are always open to criticism because everyone expects a high level of performance,’ he said. ‘The major issue with our team always seems to be the money but this season I think we were the team that spent less than any other team. That is the weird thing. ‘For this club trying to be a big team in so few years, maybe we are paying the cost for that.’ Since the transfer penalties were introduced, City have spent £91million on players in the last two windows (Net spend £68million). That compares to Manchester United £145.5million, Liverpool £113million, Arsenal £92.5million and Chelsea £82.6million. Over the same time period Barcelona spent £118.3million on players and Real Madrid £81.2million though they also broke the world transfer record for Gareth Bale the previous summer.","Manchester City have been restricted to a net transfer spend of £49m .

76,"Manny Pacquiao has become one of the most recognisable stars in the world of sport after a series of mega-fights and another one to follow on Saturday night against Floyd Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night. The one upmanship is sure to continue until fight day. Pacquiao has been involved in some of the biggest fights over the last decade but Saturday's occasion will eclipse all of them .

77,"Four teenagers have been caught on camera kicking a rare bird and throwing another out of a window. The gang broke into an aviary and bundled 200 of the animals into sacks and containers around 3.30am on January 12. CCTV showed the men took the birds to a tower block in Walsall, West Midlands, and dumped them on the floor before kicking them and forcing them out of barely open windows. Four teenagers have been caught on camera kicking a rare bird, thought to be in the bag above, and throwing another out of a window in Walsall, West Midlands, on January 12 . The birds were also jammed into drawers, squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard. One resident reported that a dead bird was posted through his letterbox while others were dropped through windows. Three men and a youth have been convicted of their involvement and will be sentenced next month. Chad Worgan, from Walsall, admitted an offence of receiving stolen goods and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal on the basis that he kicked a pigeon. The 19-year-old knew the animals were in the bags and had a 'sick grin across his face' as he appearing to grab one of the perched birds and visibly squeeze it, the court heard. Thomas Knox, from Bloxwich, denied the same charges. A dog belonging to Knox, also 19, was let into the flat to terrorise the birds, it was revealed. Jake Higgs, 23, from Bloxwich, admitted receiving stolen goods but denied causing unnecessary suffering. A 16-year-old from Erdington, Birmingham, also attended but cannot be named for legal reasons. The birds were also jammed into drawers, shoved through barely open windows (above), squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. One of the men (above) can be seen with a grin on his face during the attack . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. Bob Thomas, chairman of the bench, said their actions amounted to 'joint enterprise'. He added: 'They arrive with a dog and are seen to be carrying a variety of bags and containers. These are emptied by them and both a large number of dead and live birds are seen. 'The CCTV shows all of them entering the property together and all playing some part in the birds' suffering. 'We are satisfied that they were all aware of the contents of the bags.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'The birds were stolen from an aviary in the Brownhills area in the early hours of January 12. 'They were then taken to Dolphin House where they were emptied onto the landing area of the block.' The birds were stolen from rare bird breeder Lee Williams who had built up his collection of rare jays, finches, doves, budgerigars, quails and pigeons over a number of years. In 2008, the dad-of-two considered giving up his passion after 270 animals worth £4,000 were stolen. Speaking at the time, his wife Michelle said: 'This has devastated him. His bird breeding plays a major part of his life.'","Gang bundled birds from aviary in Brownhills, West Midlands into sacks .

78,"Bikini-clad models needed a head for heights as they took to this catwalk in China -  2,000 metres high on a mountainside. The girls put aside their fear of heights as they paraded along the narrow footpath in red bikinis and black high heels in a 'test of their composure' as part of a Chinese beauty pageant. The challenge was part of the central China stage of the annual Miss Bikini of the Universe contest, which has been running since 2005, according to the People's Daily Online. Don't look down: Models at a beauty pageant look a little unsure as they stand on a glass walkway, 2,000 metres up in Luoyang . Holding on: Many of the models held onto the safety railings as they made their way up the cliff pathway to take part in the competition . 'First of all, it allowed us to become more courageous, and second it allowed us to practice our most fundamental skills,' said contestant, Yang Ningqing. 'This catwalk, even though it was a very crude catwalk, allowed us to show off our most beautiful posture.' Another contestant, Wang Linwei, said: 'I have never done training on a cliff, I'm not going to lie, it is a little scary.' The uneven footpath along the side of the Luanchuan Laojun mountain in Henan Province, central China, is only one-metre wide, which did little to ease nerves.

Treading carefully: The high-heeled beauty pageant models make careful steps up the cliff pathway, which is 2,000 metres up . Strike a pose: Judges at the contest said they wanted to make sure the contestants could keep their cool under pressure . Some models decided to kick off their heels and walk bare-footed to negotiate the potholes. While the girls seemed to enjoy themselves, some Chinese social media users criticised organisers for making them strut along the side of a mountain. One user wrote: 'Who is it that came up with such a bad idea to torture the beauties? It is so windy on the mountains. Try getting your daughter up on the cliff with bikinis on.' The girls were competing to get to the national final in Beijing. It is not the first the time that organisers have pushed their contestants to their limit.

Kim Pappas, 25, was two hours into her working day at Ceva Logistics in Wyandotte, Michigan, on March 31 when she disappeared to the bathroom to deliver the boy - and cut the umbilical cord with cuticle scissors. Nobody knew she was pregnant. Charged: Kim Pappas, 25, has been charged with premeditated murder after giving birth in her office toilet then wrapping her baby boy in a plastic bag and secretly putting him in her desk drawer. The baby died . Her attempt at secrecy, however, was foiled minutes later when two employees went to the restroom, which was covered in blood. Returning to the office of the freight management company they saw traces of blood on Pappas' clothing, and found the lifeless infant wrapped up at her feet. Pappas has been charged with premeditated murder. According to Fox, workers went to the bathroom after hearing moaning and crying - but Pappas had already left. They alerted emergency services and went round every employee. Noticing the blood on Pappas, she was questioned and they searched her desk. It was not until they discovered the baby in the drawer that she admitted what had happened. Shock: Nobody at Ceva Logistics, Michigan, knew Pappas was pregnant until they saw blood in the cubicle . Court: Pappas appeared in court on Friday via videolink to be arraigned. She has been denied bail . The child was sealed inside a plastic bag, which was wrapped in a tote bag. He showed no signs of life at the office and was later pronounced dead in hospital. It is believed he was in the bag for between 15 and 30 minutes, according to the Detroit Free Press.

80,"A family falsely claimed their three-year-old daughter had a grave heart condition in a bid to collect thousands of dollars in donations on a GoFundMe page, according to police. Joanessa Clawson, 35, her husband James Clawson, 38, and her mother Patti Ann Baldassarre, 68, from Marietta, Georgia, all face felony conspiracy charges. The GoFundMe page, which has now been removed, is written from the point of view of a family friend - who allegedly does not exist - appealing for help for the Clawson family. 'I am posting this for my friend Jo Clawson whose 3-year-old daughter, Sofia, is very ill with a life threatening heart infection,' it reads, according to an image of the page shared by KESQ. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Joanessa Clawson, left, and her husband James Clawson, right, face felony conspiracy charges after they allegedly set up a fake GoFundMe account asking for donations . 'Fake': They pretended to be a friend asking for money for their daughter, claiming that the girl was in hospital with a heart infection after surgery. They asked for $3,000 on the GoFundMe page . 'This happened 2 weeks after Sofia underwent heart surgery to repair a defect that she was born with. This fellow East Cobb family runs their own home-based business.' When shared by KESQ, the page, entitled 'Sofia's Medical and Family Expenses', had raised just $195 but was asking for $3,000. It is not clear how much money the page eventually raised. The couple has two children, the daughter and an older son, according to their Facebook pages. Friends told the channel that they had their suspicions about the fundraiser because their stories did not seem to add up - and the couple has been accused of running scams in the past. In 2006, they were accused by dozens of couples of accepting payments to take wedding photos in Cabazon, California but never delivering the images. Scam: Clawson's mother Patti Ann Baldassarre posed as a nurse to back up the couple's story . Speaking to KESQ, neighbors said they tried to alert police to the fake page months ago. 'There were tons of red flags and there were tons of people in the community who reached out just for the sake of her kids,' Sandra May said. 'And nothing was done.' When they voiced their suspicions, Mrs Clawson allegedly produced a note from a doctor providing the donors a number for a nurse if they had any concerns. But the number on the letter allegedly led to Baldassarre's phone, and the doctor named in the letter had retired years earlier, according to KESQ. After a teacher leaned of the page, she asked Cobb County School Police to check in on the three-year-old daughter and discovered that the child was in fact healthy. The trio was arrested on felony conspiracy charges. Mrs Clawson is also charged with felony theft by deception, while her husband faces an additional charge of misdemeanor obstruction of a law enforcement officer. He posted $5,000 bail but his wife remains behind bars on $10,000 bond and her mother is held on $2,500 bond. In 2006, more than 20 couples said they never received wedding photos despite paying the couple. Arrested: Mrs Clawson, pictured left and right with her older child, was arrested after a teacher asked police to check on the wellbeing of the three-year-old daughter and found she was fine, according to reports . Home: The couple moved to Marietta, Georgia (pictured) after allegedly running a wedding photography business in California - but they allegedly failed to give their clients photos after they were paid . They also accused them of stealing other photographers' work and claiming it was their own in order to promote their business. 'Hired Joanessa Clawson for July 2006 wedding in Los Angeles. Takes great photos but no where to be found once the wedding is over,' one enraged client wrote online in 2006. 'Once they get your check Joanessa and her husband, James, will make every excuse in the book on why you haven't received your photos!! (i.e. Joanessa has health problems from a stroke to the flu to a heart attack, FEDEX is to blame, they have other weddings to tend to etc). 'She may be more affordable than other photographers but in the end, you definitely get what you pay for, nothing.' KESQ reported that some of the clients took the Clawsons to court and won financial judgments.

81,"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers vowed not to give up on Champions League qualification after a convincing 2-0 win over Newcastle. The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield. With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener . Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead . Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf . 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City . He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball . Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'","Liverpool beat Newcastle 2-0 in the Premier League on Monday night .

82,"Steven Abberley caused a major security alert by throwing marbles at MPs and shouting 'you are all just liars' during Prime Minister's Questions . A protester who caused a major security alert by throwing marbles at MPs and shouting 'you are all just liars' during Prime Minister's Questions has walked free from court. Steven Abberley, 28, hurled a tirade of abuse at politicians during a session in the House of Commons in October last year. He then threw the glass balls from the public gallery, but they missed MPs and hit a security screen. Abberley excused himself to fellow observers before shouting 'you are all just liars' at Prime Minister David Cameron and the rest of the chamber during the televised Parliamentary debate. When arrested, Abberley told police officers that he had daubed the words 'the enemy within' in red paint on the palace's walls, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told. Prosecutor Mavis Ramkissoon said the incident happened five minutes before the end of the weekly question-and-answer session. She said: 'Without warning at 12.25pm, Mr Abberley stood up and began to shout, ""I'm sorry about this ladies and gentlemen"". 'Mr Abberley's arms were outstretched, he said: ""you f***ing w*****s, you are just liars"".' Abberley, who is unemployed, then interjected from the dock, telling the court: 'Can I just say for the record I didn't call anyone ""f***ing w*****s"". I called them ""dishonourable b******s"".' Ms Ramkissoon continued: 'He produced a cloth bag and threw the contents of the bag at the security screen, causing a loud bang.' The prosecutor said there was no damage to the screen, but the marbles scattered causing 'distress and shock' to the people in the gallery. 'When he was arrested, Abberley made admissions to the arresting officer concerning criminal damage to the Palace of Westminster', she said. Abberley had scrawled the words 'the enemy within' on the wall just outside the public gallery. Steven Abberley, pictured with his mother, hurled a tirade of abuse at politicians during a session in the House of Commons in October last year . Abberley threw the glass balls from the public gallery during Prime Minister's Questions, but they missed MPs and hit a security screen (file picture) There is no footage of Abberley spray painting the wall, and the judge said he would not have been caught if he had not told the police what he had done. Ms Ramkissoon said it cost £2,416 to remove the graffiti. The court heard that Abberley, whose mother was in court today, is taking medication for mental health and a behavioural disorder. He said that he is looking for a job, and is hoping to join the Army. Abberley, from Carshalton, south London, admitted one count of criminal damage and one of threatening behaviour. District Judge Quentin Purdy sentenced him to eight weeks in prison for throwing the marbles and four weeks for the graffiti, but suspended both jail terms. 'Your personal view of politicians, whatever they may be, are entirely a matter for you,' he said. The unemployed 28-year-old was given suspended sentences for criminal damage and threatening behaviour . 'But the difficult you have is how you chose to express it, by criminal damage and your antics in the gallery at the House of Commons. 'People are entitled to go to that place and listen calmly to that said below. You chose to disrupt them.' The judge said Abberley had caused 'disquiet' which may force others to think again about attending Parliament. 'Those that cause disruption at the Palace of Westminster have a knock-on effect to other freedoms and confidence in going that, and that must be actively deterred.' The sentences will run concurrently and Abberley has been ordered to pay back £500 in compensation at a rate of £5 a fortnight. He will also undergo supervision sessions for two years, mental health treatment for the next year, and pay an £80 victim surcharge.","Steven Abberley threw marbles during PMQs but they hit a security screen .

83,"Christian Benteke rescued Aston Villa from the drop zone with a brilliant late free-kick to seal his hat-trick and salvage a point against relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers. Tim Sherwood’s team were set to drop into the bottom three when Charlie Austin scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season 12 minutes from the end, before Benteke’s intervention five minutes later to cap off a pulsating game. The point lifts QPR above Burnley to 18th on goal difference, while Villa move above Hull to 16th. Tim Sherwood was disappointed that Aston Villa's domination of QPR did not result in three points for his side . Sherwood did concede that the point taken could be vital and praised Christian Benteke for his hat-trick . Sherwood said: ‘I’m disappointed with a point when we’ve dominated the match like that. The referee should have stopped it at half-time. Anyone who has seen that football match knows it shouldn’t have been close. ‘But it’s not about what you deserve, it’s about what you actually get. This could be a vital point come the end of the season. When you’re going so late into the game and Christian’s had to pull that one out of the bag, we’re grateful for that.’ Chris Ramsey was equally frustrated that his team only took a point from Villa Park, having twice led, initially through Matt Phillips’ header. Benteke equalised with a deflected shot before putting Villa ahead before the break with a cool finish. Defender Clint Hill levelled the game with a header before Austin struck and Benteke scored his seventh goal in five Villa games to ensure honours finished even. Benteke was Villa's star man, twice pulling them level with three goals that earned a point at Villa Park . Charlie Austin had scored late on for QPR as they looked to claim and unlikely away end in the Midlands . Ramsey praised Benteke, saying: ‘He is a formidable player. When you are playing against people that can pull out that little bit of magic, sometimes you have to hold your hands up. His free-kick was a fantastic strike in off the post against a top keeper, who had it been anywhere else probably would have saved it.’ The QPR head coach added: ‘Based on the way we played in the second half and the beginning of the first half you have to be disappointed you haven’t been able to get above the line, which was the aim before we started the last two games. We showed tonight we’re more than capable of doing that. I don’t know what we need but we’re probably going to have to win three games. We know our next home games will be very important. We have the potential cup final against Leicester on the last game of the season. QPR head coach Chris Ramsey called Benteke a 'formidable player' after he took apart the visitors . Sherwood and Ramsey embrace before kick-off having spent periods of their careers working together . ‘Any team would take being in it right till the end and then roll the dice. You don’t want to become detached where every game is a mountain to climb. There is a belief in the camp they are capable of surviving, there is no doom and gloom.’ Sherwood added: ‘We’re creating chances, aren’t we? I can’t really understand why they scored 12 goals before I came in, incredible really for players with that kind of strike-rate... we must keep our tempo up and shore it up at the back. Otherwise we could find ourselves in trouble.’ Sherwood now takes his team to Tottenham and Manchester City. ‘Who is to say we can’t go to any of those games and win?’ he said. ‘We’ll try. We can’t do what QPR have done today, we’ll play on the front foot.’ .","Aston Villa draw 3-3 with QPR  with Christian Benteke scoring a hat-trick .

84,"(CNN)The accidental death of a 2-year-old boy in Milwaukee on Sunday triggered a violent chain of events, eventually claiming the lives of three more people. It all started with a birthday party that little Damani Terry was attending. During the family gathering, he dashed out into the street and was struck and killed by a GMC van, according to Milwaukee police. The distraught driver, Archie Brown Jr., 40, immediately stopped and got out to tend to the boy. But it was too late, police said. Damani was dead. Damani's alarmed family came running, including his older brother, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, police said. That was not the end of the situation. Soon, two more people would also die: the driver and the teen were both felled by bullets fired by the same man, police said. That man, identified as Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, was located late Wednesday at a Chicago-area hotel. He committed suicide as authorities closed in with a warrant for his arrest, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn told reporters. ""Chicago police and United States Marshals Service entered the hotel room, whereupon Mr. Chiles took his own life with his firearm,"" the police chief said Thursday. An accidental death, a fatal retaliation rips apart two families . Damani's family members had previously identified the shooting suspect as the boys' uncle. ""Sunday was the worst day I ever lived in my whole entire life,"" Lena Tidwell, told CNN affiliate WISN. ""It's a day I wish had never, never came."" Tidwell is the boys' grandmother and the mother of the alleged gunman. She said she was inside eating cake and ice cream at the birthday when her life turned upside down. ""I didn't know my grandbaby got hit, and then I heard people just screaming,"" she said. ""Then I just heard gunshots, and my daughter ran in the house with the baby in her arms."" The family believes the uncle targeted Brown, and Rasheed was struck by an errant bullet. ""I heard he was trying to pick his brother up. He was trying to hold him and save him,"" a family friend, Stephanie Townsend, told CNN affiliate WITI. Earlier this week, Flynn bemoaned the apparent madness of what happened. ""What did we have Sunday?"" Flynn asked. ""We had some clown take the law into his own hands and murder a guy who was doing what we expect good citizens to do, and oops, accidentally kill somebody else.""","Ricky Ricardo Chiles III was suspected in the shooting deaths of two people .

85,"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has written off Manchester City’s chances of signing Raheem Sterling this summer by declaring the Anfield club are bigger than their Etihad rivals and making it clear they have no intention of becoming their feeder team. Ahead of Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley, Rodgers indicated it could take two decades for Sheik Mansour’s club to reach the status of either Liverpool or Manchester United. City have been heavily linked with a £50million move for Sterling, who has two years left on his contract and is stalling on a new deal. The champions have also monitored vice-captain Jordan Henderson, who only has a season left on his Anfield contract. Brendan Rodgers says that a move to Manchester City would not be step up for Raheem Sterling . Rodgers talks to Sterling during Friday's training session ahead of FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa . However, Rodgers was emphatic that moving to City would not represent a step up. ‘If you say that City is a bigger club than Liverpool, you’re wrong,’ he said. ‘I’ve got big respect for what City are doing — they’re trying to build it the right way. But at this moment you can’t compare the size of the two clubs. ‘You’ve got Liverpool and United, the two biggest clubs in this country and the rest of them are fighting to be there over the next 20 years. I wouldn’t say we were a development ground for going to “bigger” clubs.’ City have tried to sign players from Arsenal and Liverpool hoping to weaken their rivals. They have bought Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Kolo Toure from Arsenal but failed to lure Fernando Torres when he was at Anfield. Sterling is wanted by Manchester City this summer for £50million as he stalls over new contract . Sterling has been one of Liverpool's leading lights and was nominated for PFA Young Player of the Year . This summer, Liverpool will also try to sign James Milner from City. Rodgers hopes victory over Villa will strengthen his case and increase the chances of keeping players. ‘Our vision is to win trophies,’ he said. ‘The first objective was to get into the Champions League again. We arrived there this year and could focus on winning a trophy. We just have to concentrate on performance levels, get to the final and we’ll take it from there.’ Club captain Steven Gerrard is available after a three-match ban and Rodgers has to decide whether to start with him in what could be his final appearance at Wembley before his move to LA Galaxy.

86,"Czech immigrants were trafficked into the UK by a Roma family on the promise of a 'better life' were forced to work for free and sleep in cupboards, a court was told. The victims were lured to Britain but were 'treated like dogs' - being made to urinate in buckets and live and eat outside in winter, prosecutors say. The jury heard how the workers were kept under duress amid fears for the safety of their families back home and sent to work in dog food factories, food plants and car washes in Plymouth, Devon. But they were made to give over all their wages, forced to eat outside during the winter and do housework to pay off 'loans' for their board and passage, a jury heard. Accused: Petr Tancos (left) and sister Ruzena Tancosova (right) are on trial for people trafficking in Plymouth . The allegations of their shocking treatment were made during a trial of five family members at Plymouth Crown Court. Ruzena Tancosova, 34, brother Petr Tancos, 35, cousin Martin Tancos, 35, Nela Dzurkova, 26, and Katerina Kurejova, 35, all of Plymouth, are charged with people trafficking. All deny the charges. Police say victims would be threatened with violence by the gang who pocketed their wages and benefits - believed to be around £150,000 - and even made them shoplift. Malcolm Galloway, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the five defendants, all members of an extended Czech Roma family, brought the immigrants over. He said a neighbour also saw one standing by and directing one of the men to cut grass with a kitchen knife. He said: 'These defendants entered into a criminal agreement to traffick other Czech nationals into the UK and then exploit them for financial benefit.' Mr Galloway said: 'They (the immigrants) came with a promise of good pay, a job and a future.' Mr Galloway said the family used various methods to exploit the men - including for example putting a notice on the toilet door charging £1 for its use. But the court heard that the men were also threatened with violence if they failed to comply. He said: 'They would put them up in their houses in Plymouth. The Czech nationals would sometimes have to sleep on the floor, outside in the garage. 'They would have to urinate in buckets and eat outside.' He added that police started surveillance after two immigrants went to the authorities. Officers then searched their properties on September 16 last year. The court heard one man, Josef Bukovinsky, told police he had been 'living with the gypsies' in the Czech Republic before he was 'sold to Ruzena' (Tancosova). On trial: Nela Dzurkova (left) and Katerina Kurejova (right) are part of a Roma family accused of illegally trafficking Czech migrants into the UK and 'treating them like dogs' Mr Galloway said he was one of 11 men who lived with Tancosova in less than three years at a former address in Plymouth. All five defendants are charged with conspiracy to traffic individuals into the country for the purpose of exploitation between April 6, 2013, and September 16, 2014. Tancosova, Petr Tancos and Dzurkova are also charged with the same offence again but applying to an earlier period between January 1, 2010, and April 5, 2013. Tancosova and Martin Tancos are further accused of acting as gangmasters in supplying workers to pack agricultural products. Tancosova and Petr Tancos also allegedly required a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between 2010 and 2014. Mr Galloway told the trial that Tancos was seen by neighbours at different addresses to supervise the immigrants. He said a neighbour of Tancos and partner and co-defendant Nela Dzurkova spotted three men apparently living in their garage. The woman told police she saw Dzurkova passing food out of the kitchen window to men who stood in the garden of the house eating from trays in winter. He said: 'She also saw Petr Tancos standing by and directing one of the men to cut the grass with a kitchen knife.' He said the man was on his hands and knees. Mr Galloway said the neighbour noticed that Petr Tancos encouraged his children to throw stones at the men. She estimated that between 10 and 12 men lived at the home at different times. Mr Galloway said another immigrant, Miroslav Ritter, stayed with Petr Tancos and Dzurkova at their last address. He added: 'He slept, in his words, like a dog under the window in the living room, in a gap between the table and window. 'He slept on the carpet with a blanket and a pillow.' Jan Banyak told police he stayed at the home of Martin Tancos and Kurejova and £600 a month in rent to sleep on the kitchen floor. Mr Banyak believed that he earned about £250 a week working in a factory, but he did not know where the money went. He only received about £10 from Martin Tancos. Mr Galloway said: 'He told the police they usually had to eat outside. There were 10 of them and Katerina Kurejova did not want them inside as there were only two rooms. They eat mostly tinned food.' He added that when police raided the address, they found two other men sleeping on mattresses, under the stairs and in the kitchen. Mr Galloway said Tancosova, who had four bank accounts, pocketed £86,517 in benefits over four years and eight months. He added: 'The credit turnover for the accounts, including benefit payments, amounted to £148,923.' Mr Galloway said police had not been able to trace everyone they suspected of staying at the rented homes of the family. The trial continues.

87,"An eight-year-old girl, who lost her leg in a terrible accident last year, has given her first solo dance performance since she became an amputee eleven months ago - earning a standing ovation for her moving routine. Alissa Sizemore, from Vernal, Utah, was only seven-years-old when a truck ran over her foot and immediately severed it. Although the dancer, who has been taking lessons since she was four-years-old, had to have her right leg amputated below the knee, she was determined to get back in the dance studio as soon as possible. 'I just didn't want to give up,' Alissa told People. 'Dancing has been my favorite thing since I was four. I don't have part of my leg, but I can't let that stop me. I still want to dance.' Scroll down for video . Major Inspiration: Alissa Sizemore can be seen dancing on a wooden bench during her first solo dance performance since she lost her leg in an accident last May . Alissa, who was fitted for her prosthetic leg in September, chose Colbie Caillat's hit Try, a song that she and her mom felt accurately reflected her emotional journey over the past year, for her debut performance, in which she removed her artificial limb as a part of her routine. Alissa's mom Heather proudly shared a video of her daughter's performance last month on her YouTube channel. The clip shows Alissa donning a seafoam green ballet costume as she confidently walks toward a bench set up in the middle of Vernal's high school gymnasium, where the recital took place. The impressive little girl performs a series of leg stretches and even a cartwheel before she removed her prosthetic limb. Unstoppable girl: The eight-year-old lifted her prosthetic limb while balancing on one leg for her routine, which was set to Colbie Caillat's hit Try . Dare devil: She even did a cartwheel in the middle of her performance at a high school gymnasium in in Vernal, Utah . Determined: Towards the end of her emotional dance, Alissa removed her artificial leg and continued her routine on the floor, where she did a bridge and a forward roll . After removing her artificial leg, she continues her routine on the floor, proving that she will always be able to dance - with or without her leg. The teary-eyed audience was so moved by her dancing that she was given a standing ovation - a fantastic end to an emotional year. And one which will hopefully help to dull the memory of the horrific accident which left her in pain for months. Last May, Alissa was playing outside with her sister Cyley, 10, and some of her friends when she ran past a few garbage cans that were pulled to the curb just as a truck was breaking to a stop. Alissa's right foot was pinned underneath the tire. She was immediately flown to Vernal to Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, but doctors were unable to save her leg. Amazing recovery: Alissa was photographed warming up for ballet class at Powerhouse Dance Studio last month . In sync: She can be seen performing a routine with the other girls in her class . Star treatment: Alissa got her hair done before she was filmed dancing in the music video for Utah musical trio Gentri's song Dare . Alissa was reliant on a wheelchair or crutches before she was fitted for her artificial leg, but she was secretly doing uncomplicated dance moves in the studio her father had built for her and her sisters. While Alissa adjusted to her new reality, her neighborhood community banded together to help raise money for her surgeries and her prosthetic leg, which weren't completely covered by the family's health insurance. When her mom took her and her sisters to Powerhouse Dance Studio last summer for fall tryouts, it was thought that Alissa would help with the music until she was ready to return to dance - but she had other plans. Say cheese: The little girl posed for this photo with Casey Elliott, Brad Robins and Bradley Quinn Lever, who make up the group . Inspiring words: In the music video, Alissa holds up a sign that reads: 'Dare to dream.' 'She handed me her crutches and said she was trying out,' her mom told People. 'She hopped to the middle of the room and gave it her all. She wasn't going to let anybody hold her back.' Alissa's amazing story inspired Utah musical trio Gentri to feature her in the music video for their song Dare. Throughout the clip, which debuted earlier this month, Alissa can be seen attaching her prosthetic leg before she starts dancing. The footage also shows her holding up pictures of herself during her recovery last year, as well as a newspaper article about her recent dance recital. Towards the end of the video, Alissa raises a sign that reads: 'Dare to dream.'

She was in the Gulf state, ruled by a controversial king whose regime has been accused of violently repressing pro-democracy activists, with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, according to an onlooker who saw her among dignitaries on the starting grid before the race. ‘She was walking behind the Crown Prince of Bahrain.

91,"Fired: Stephen Hogger, pictured, was sacked after apparently falling out with senior church figures . As the congregation of St Peter and St Paul Church filed in for the Easter Sunday service, thoughts naturally turned to the meaning of sacrifice. But little did they know it would be put into action by the entire choir moments later. A letter handed out to the stunned churchgoers revealed the 13 choristers were quitting en masse in ‘solidarity’ over the sacking of music director Stephen Hogger. The walkout means it will be the first time in 200 years that the church, which is famed for its timber-framed Tudor buildings, will be without a choir. The 55-year-old, who had been at the 14th century church in Lavenham, Suffolk, for 17 years, was given notice to leave following an apparent falling out with senior figures. A villager, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It seems to be down to a clash of personalities. Some people at the church feel that Mr Hogger can come across as abrasive and even rude on occasion. ‘There have been comments about him being dismissive and offhand to members of the public, like couples who are planning on getting married and are not regular members of the congregation. ‘He has also not turned up to some meetings and has failed to keep arrangements to talk to people.’ ‘It was felt that his behaviour was out of line with how the church wanted to be seen but members of the choir have always had a great respect for him. They admire him because he is very gifted musically.’ Church organist Mr Hogger, who is a Fellow of the Guild of Musicians and Singers and Associate of the London College of Music, said: ‘Obviously it is all a bit difficult.

Mr Hogger was given three months’ notice to terminate the contract on his part-time paid post on March 29 by the PCC. Chorister Gillian Smith, 67, who has sung at the church for 30 years, said: ‘All I want to say is that we resigned to show solidarity with Stephen Hogger. That is the reason we came out in support of him.’ Another chorister, who declined to be named, added they were ‘disappointed and upset’. ‘At the end of the day it is not a very Christian attitude that has been shown to Stephen,’ they said. Stephen Earl, 61, the rector of the church, was away on holiday yesterday and unavailable to comment. Church warden Graham Patrick said: ‘The basic facts are that the PCC have given three months’ notice to our director of music. ‘In solidarity with him, the choir has also decided to leave, something which we in the church very much regret.’ John Howard, a spokesman for the diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, added everyone ‘wish him well in the next phase of his career.’","Easter Sunday congregation handed a letter explaining choir had quit .

93,"Prince Andrew will not face court action in the US over claims he had sex with an under-age girl, after a Florida judge ruled her claims must be struck out. Virginia Roberts had hoped to join a lawsuit involving Andrew’s friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted paedophile and sex offender. But last night Judge Kenneth Marra ordered her claims that she was a ‘sex slave’ to Epstein and was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times should be ‘struck from the record’. Scroll down for video . Virginia Roberts photographed with Prince Andrew in early 2001. Her claims she was forced to sleep with him have now been struck from the court record . Prince Andrew pictured leaving an Easter service at Windsor Castle on Sunday. The judge ruled the details of the accusations against him had no bearing on the reopening of the lawsuit against Epstein . The judge refused to make a statement regarding the veracity of Miss Roberts’s allegations, but issued an order that the ‘lurid’ and ‘unnecessary’ claims should not be involved in the Epstein case. ‘At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary,’ he wrote. ‘These unnecessary details shall be stricken.’ Prince Andrew is not mentioned by name in the ten-page ruling, made in the Palm Beach County court, Florida. But Judge Marra refers to the powerful people Miss Roberts was allegedly forced to have sex with by Epstein. Her claims of taking part in an orgy with the Duke and sleeping with him on two other occasions when she was 17 – below the age of consent in Florida – were described as ‘immaterial and impertinent’. In 17 words, the judge may have drawn a line under a controversy that has dogged Prince Andrew since January. Miss Roberts, referred to as ‘Jane Doe 3’ in court papers, and another woman were hoping to join two other alleged victims of Epstein in suing the U.S. government over a plea deal prosecutors struck with the financier. Jeffrey Epstein allegedly kept Virginia Roberts as a 'sex slave' But Judge Marra ruled yesterday that the Jane Doe 3 and 4 applications should be denied and it was therefore ‘unnecessary’ for them to be added as plaintiffs. When the court claim surfaced earlier this year, Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace refused to go into any details regarding the accusations. However, in late January he briefly referred to the allegations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying he wanted to ‘reiterate and reaffirm’ palace statements that insisted he never had any sexual contact or relationship with Miss Roberts. She has repeatedly claimed she had sex three times with Andrew when she was 17 – a claim he emphatically denies – and served papers on him via the British Embassy in Washington DC. But they were returned to sender. Her legal team’s bid to serve papers on the Duke came after courier FedEx returned a similar letter as it was ‘refused’ by the recipient at Buckingham Palace. The court papers lodged in Florida accused Andrew of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17. She claimed that under the orders of paedophile Epstein she was ‘forced’ to have sex with the prince three times in 2001 – in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island. The 55-year-old royal was so concerned about the allegations that he consulted top criminal QC William Clegg. Andrew’s long friendship with Epstein was said to include lavish parties and exotic holidays, but it raised questions over the prince’s choice of friends. He was introduced to the billionaire by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell. The fifth in line to the throne was forced to effectively cool, but not end, the friendship when sex claims were made against the financier. In June 2008, Epstein began serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to soliciting a girl, 14, for prostitution. Andrew was summoned by the Queen after pictures emerged of him in New York with Epstein in February 2011, after the financier had been released from prison. It emerged Epstein had given Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson £15,000 to help reduce her debts. Last night Buckingham Palace declined to comment. The Duke was not a party to the court action and was not given the opportunity to rebut the allegations through the court.

TV presenter and motorcycle racer Guy Martin, who is facing a police probe after boasting he drove an Aston Martin at 180mph in a 40mph zone during a review . In the review published in the Sunday Times Driving magazine, he wrote: 'I saw 180mph down Sulby Straight, one of the fastest sections of the course, and the car wasn't even in top gear.' He also added of how he roared around the course at 6am in the morning and that he probably completed the course only two minutes shy of the record for a car, which is 19 minutes and 26 seconds. Mr Martin also wrote: 'As soon as I passed Union Mills, on to a section with no speed limit, I thought: “Right, let’s have it.” 'I was revving with excitement. I hadn't been trying to set a time; I just wanted to see what the car would do an a road I knew well and it was something like a 22-minute lap.' Mr Martin was driving an Aston Martin Vanquish, similar to the one pictured, when he claimed he reached the top speed . However, after the review was published earlier this month, police on the Isle of Man have confirmed they are looking into the incident which saw the racing driver allegedly going four times the speed limit.

96,"The Arkansas judge who posted private details of Charlize Theron's adoption of her son has been forced to hand in his law licence because of a bribery conviction in a separate case. By surrendering his licence, circuit Judge Michael Maggio has avoided a disciplinary hearing over the conviction, for which he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced in July. Maggio, 52, sparked controversy last March when he admitted posting a series of comments that were racist, sexist and offensive towards the LGBT community over the past several years. Charlize Theron pictured with Jackson, the boy she adopted from her native South Africa. Michael Maggio revealed the Hollywood actress had adopted two months before she announced it publically .

His comments in January 2012 divulged details of Theron's adoption - two months before she publicly released the information. On the message board, Maggio said a 'judge friend' had handled  Theron's adoption, before admitting that he was also involved in the case. When a poster asked if she had adopted a black child, he said that she had. Such proceedings are confidential in Arkansas. Theron adopted the boy, Jackson, from her native South Africa. In a June 2011 posting, 'geauxjudge' suggested that women who seek divorces after their husbands cheat may be better off financially by staying married. 'I see it everyday,' he wrote. 'A woman makes (an) emotional decision to divorce because the husband stepped out. When otherwise he was a good provider, father, and husband. 'Then a year or two later realizes uh oh I am worse off financially, emotionally and relationship wise but hey they showed that SOB. Too many times the women get their advice from other divorced women.' In another, Maggio, who has three sons and two daughters from a previous relationship and lives with his partner, Dawn, made derogatory comments about women, saying they needed to take care of a man's two basic needs for sex and food, adding: 'It takes two to pull the wagon'. Responding to a story about a woman who was arrested for allegedly having sex with a dog, 'geauxjudge' wrote that it was 'just a small step' from having 'TGGLBS' sex, an apparent reference to transgender, gay, lesbian or bisexual sex. Two months after he pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges Maggio filed a request with the Arkansas Supreme Court in March to voluntarily surrender his law licence in order to 'avoid the expense, stress and publicity of further addressing his [bribery] conviction', according to court notes. Now he has been completely barred from practising law in Arkansas and removed from the state's registry of licensed attorneys.

Postings on the website TigerDroppings.com show Maggio discussing confidential information about Theron's adoption application . Prosecutors in Maggio's bribery case said he accepted campaign donations from nursing home owner Michael Morton and a lobbyist in exchange for reducing a jury award in a negligence case. In that case, Maggio reduced the jury award from $5.2 million to $1 million in a lawsuit stemming from the death of a nursing home patient. Campaign finance records showed Morton's political action committees contributed money to Maggio's campaign for the Arkansas Court of Appeals. The family of the woman who died, Martha Bull, filed a lawsuit late last year against Maggio, nursing home owner Michael Morton and lobbyist Gilbert Baker protesting the reduction of the award.

97,"Haris Vuckic stands as the one bonus from a now infamous deal. While the other members of the Newcastle Five have managed a paltry 44 minutes of football between them, the Slovenian has positively thrived at Rangers. So much so, in fact, that he admits any possibility of staying at Ibrox beyond the end of this season would be an immensely attractive option. Whether or not that can happen will depend on a number of factors. Vuckic has denied a report on Tyneside stating he had already declared his intention to quit St James Park, where he has one year left on his contract. Summer discussions with his parent club will have to take place. Haris Vuckic has thrived at Rangers under new manager Stuart McCall . By then, he will also know whether Rangers have fulfilled their aim of promotion via the play-offs. Certainly, he has done much so far to try to make Premier League football a reality at Ibrox once again. Vuckic has scored six times since signing for Rangers, including three in his last two appearances as the revival under Stuart McCall has gathered momentum. The 22-year-old is clearly relishing the exposure he has been granted. Having begun to stagnate on the fringes of the Newcastle squad, he feels revived by life in Glasgow. ‘I’m really enjoying playing my football and I’m training hard,’ said Vuckic. ‘At Newcastle, I didn’t have that chance. ‘But it’s nonsense that I have said I am going to quit Newcastle. I never said that. I still respect Newcastle because I have a year left there. And I also respect Rangers because I have a loan deal here. ‘We will see what is going to happen in the transfer window and what Newcastle have to say. I will get options and I have to take the option that is best for me.’ And if Rangers were to make an offer for his services come the end of the season? Vuckic has won over Rangers fans with six goals from 10 games, including this strike against Hearts . ‘That would be a good option because I’m really enjoying my football here,’ replied Vuckic. ‘I’m scoring goals, playing well and the fans like me. It would be a great option for me. ‘This is the happiest I have been for a while with my football because I am playing every week. As a player, that is all you want. To show people that you are good.’ Clearly, there is little appeal in returning to Tyneside simply to spend another 12 months stuck in the reserves or filling space on the bench. ‘That wouldn’t be the best option for me,’ he admitted. ‘Playing first-team football is very different from the Under-21s, where you basically play with the kids. You want to play at a bigger, stronger level. ‘In football you have to take a step back to go forward. I feel from Newcastle to Rangers on loan I took that step back but now I want to go forward. ‘If I go back to play Under-21 games with Newcastle I would go even more back. I just have to see what happens in the summer but I want to play first-team football. ‘When I was 18 or 19 years old I was getting a chance in the first team at Newcastle but I broke my hand on my debut against Fulham. ‘I had a couple of set-backs and after spending a couple of months out you have to fight again for your place. I feel I could have done more in Newcastle if I hadn’t had the injuries.’ The 22-year-old celebrates scoring a goal for Newcastle, but could find himself leaving St James' Park . Vuckic was deemed sufficiently surplus to requirements to be shipped out in a mass deal arranged when the previous board were still in place. Current interim chairman Paul Murray cited the signing of the quintet without undergoing medicals as an example of the ‘recklessness’ that preceded regime change. Gael Bigirimana will not play this season because of an unspecified ‘medical condition’ he admits was there before he joined Rangers. McCall is also sceptical about Shane Ferguson’s ability to feature, although he will finally arrive at Murray Park next week as recovers from a long-term knee injury. Kevin Mbabu has been training but has yet to make a first-team debut, while Remie Streete didn’t quite make it to half-time against Raith Rovers in February before succumbing to a hamstring injury. It was recently revealed that Rangers will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 for the privilege of the loans if they gain promotion. ‘They are all fighting for their place,’ said Vuckic of his colleagues. ‘Kevin is training, Remi is injured and we all know the problem Biggi has got. ‘I spoke to Fergie and he is coming soon, but he will have to prove himself. The plan is for him to feature before the end of the season. ‘I didn’t feel any pressure personally when I came here. I just wanted to do my maximum for the club and to gain experience. ‘Since the manager came in, I have really enjoyed it. He knows what he is talking about. We all follow his gameplan and we are winning. He came here with a target to put us in the Scottish Premiership. ‘When I first came the changing room was a little bit down because of what was going on here. ‘Now when you start winning games the players are more motivated, enthusiastic and everybody fighting. The quality of the training goes up straight away and you can develop even more.’","Haris Vuckic has spent second half of season on loan at Rangers .

98,"Wigan climbed up to third place in the First Utility Super League after exacting sweet revenge on arch-rivals St Helens for October's Grand-Final defeat. The Warriors came out on top 12-4 in a brutal, no-holds-barred contest in front of a spellbound capacity 24,054 crowd at the DW Stadium which contained just three tries but countless examples of rugby league at its finest. Defences reigned supreme and both sets of players were out on their feet long before the end of an absorbing Good Friday duel as the ferocious exchanges, on a glue-pot pitch, began to takes its toll. Wigan Warriors' Dom Manfredi (centre) celebrates with his team-mates after he scores his side's first try. It took a try from Sydney-bound winger Joe Burgess 10 minutes from the end to finally break the champions' resistance. It was a second successive defeat for Saints, who began the season under Keiron Cunningham with six wins in a row, but there was no shame in this loss. Cunningham was forced to turn to a new half-back pairing in Jordan Turner and Lance Hohaia after skipper Jon Wilkin joined Travis Burns on the injury list by pulling a hamstring in training while Paul Wellens, restored to the captaincy, limped off four minutes into the second half to prompt another re-shuffle, . Wigan could hardly have made a better start, with winger Dom Manfredi charging over for a try after just 52 seconds, reclaiming possession after Turner's attempted clearance kick was charged down by prop Lee Mossop. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi went over for the first try as his side exacted revenge over St Helens . Matty Smith kicked the goal to make it 6-0 and Saints had to scramble to prevent Manfredi and his centre Anthony Gelling adding to the Warriors' lead. Wigan were indebted to a terrific last-ditch by George Williams that brought down centre Josh Jones in full flight and, as the momentum shifted towards the visitors, it was no surprise when impressive forward Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook charged over for a try on 15 minutes. Tom Makinson, third choice marskman in the absence of Mark Percival and Burns, was unable to add the goal and Saints suffered a blow when boom second rower Joe Greenwood, just back from an elbow injury, limped off with an ankle problem. As the conditions deteriorated and fatigue set in, the game developed into a war of attrition in the second half with chances few and far between. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi (centre) is tackled by St Helens' Josh Jones (left) and James Roby . The impressive Manfredi was hauled down just short of the line while Saints loose forward Luke Thompson went close for the visitors. The key moment came 10 minutes from the end when Saints turned the ball over 20 metres out from their own line after being penned back by Wigan's tigerish tackling. Wigan substitute prop Ryan Sutton was held up on the line in the next set but the breakthrough came moments later when Burgess won the race to George Williams' grubber kick, touching the ball down with inches to spare. Ryan Hampshire kicked the conversion to put his side two scores in front and that completed the scoring in a pulsating encounter.","Wigan exact revenge on St Helens in Super League Grand-Final rematch .

Dematteis was arrested and charged with assault following the incident, according to the New York Daily News. Police said New York resident Nicholas Dematteis, 39, flew into the rage while at Bocca East (above) during brunch, and demanded a free meal around 4pm after waiting an hour and a half . 'We heard yelling and glass breaking, restaurant patron Jason Wirtz told the Daily News. 'The guy was screaming, ''I'm not paying for it!'' There was some expletives used in there.' The 34-year-old manager made attempts to calm Dematteis down, who waited an hour and a half for his omelette, when he spewed a homophobic slur at the man, according to another manager Joseph Verdi. He then allegedly grabbed the manager's neck and slammed him against the bar. Verdi added that Dematteis, who he said appeared to be drunk, was 'a lot' bigger than the manager. As the 34-year-old manager followed Dematteis outside of the restaurant, he grabbed his neck and hurled him into an elderly woman who was standing on the street, according to the Daily News. The woman got up after being knocked over and witnesses said she left before police arrived at the scene.

100,"Ben Stokes starred with the ball on the first day of England's warm-up match in St Kitts, but it was the runs of Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott that pleased him most. England dominated against a modest St Kitts & Nevis XI, dismissing them for a paltry 59 inside 27 overs and then compiling 181 for one in reply. The quality of the home batsmen made the first innings seem like little more than a glorified net session, though Stokes still impressed with a lively spell that yielded three wickets for 10. Alastair Cook plays behind square on his way to an unbeaten 95 in the tour match against a St Kitts' XI . Cook and teammate Jonathan Trott talk in between overs during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI game . More important for England's Test prospects, though, was the stand of 158 between Cook (95 not out) and Trott (72). Both men needed the comfort of big runs, Cook having been axed from the one-day side on the eve of the World Cup and Trott on his first England appearance since November 2013 - a period that has seen him battle a case of situational anxiety. He now has the chance to nail down the role of Cook's opening partner and made a solid start in admittedly favourable circumstances. 'Trotty and Cooky gave them nothing and it will stand us in good stead for the Test matches,' said Stokes. Ben Stokes spoke strongly about his team-mates after the two batsmen looked assured at the crease . Stokes had earlier taken three for 10 in an impressive spell with the ball, as England dominated the day . 'The biggest thing for a batsman is time out in the middle. You can do all the training in the nets you want but nothing quite compares to a game and they both did that well today. Trotty has been great, it is almost like he hasn't left. To see him go out and score some runs, the way he has been known to for England over the last five years, was really good to see.' Stokes arguably went over the top in his assessment of Cook's knock, but with the captain having come under pressure for his lack of major scores, it could yet prove an important effort. Stokes described his captain Cook as one of the best players in the world after his return to form . 'It was fantastic for Cooky too,' said Stokes. 'He's been out of the game for a while so to come in and look like the one of the best batsmen in the world, like he once was, was great. The tempo he played at was fantastic and any bad ball he managed to put it away, which was good to see.' For his part, Stokes looks a certainty to return to the Test side in the Caribbean. Having announced himself as an all-rounder of unusual promise in the 2013-14 Ashes, he saw his glittering rise checked by struggles for form and fitness for long periods last year. He did not even make the cut for the World Cup but now has a chance to prove his credentials once again in the longer form. Trott plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI England tour match . 'It was nice to make an impact back in the first game, even if it was just a warm-up game in an England shirt,' he said. 'I still had the nerves there and it was pretty pleasing to do well. 'I'm still working very hard on getting back into the team, which is what I want to do. Hopefully that is just the start. 'I need performances to back that up. To keep my place I know I need to keep performing, which is something I haven't been consistent with since Australia so hopefully I get a chance in the Test matches here and I can build on that.'","Ben Stokes took three wickets for 10 runs as England bowled St Kitts & Nevis XI out for just 59 in tour match .

Launching a new poster campaign showing Ms Sturgeon manipulating a puppet Labour leader, Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The only way that Ed Miliband might crawl through the gates of No10 now is if he’s carried there by the SNP. ‘Nicola Sturgeon would pull the strings and demand weaker defences, more spending and unaffordable welfare handouts. It would be a disaster.’ Scroll down for video . New poster: It is the image which the Tories hope will scare floating voters into their arms – the prospect of Nicola Sturgeon forcing Ed Miliband to implement her radical policies . The campaign comes as Ms Sturgeon uses an article in today’s Scottish Mail on Sunday to claim that she can help ‘lead the UK’. The SNP leader reveals that her party’s manifesto, to be published tomorrow, will include pledges in policy areas which don’t even directly affect Scotland. It will be the first time that the SNP has ever set out policies designed for other parts of the UK – even though people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland cannot vote for them. Her comments are certain to rile many in England, who will be aghast at the prospect of a party for which they cannot vote trying to run their country. Ms Sturgeon also gives an ‘absolute guarantee’ that she will not use success in this year’s General Election as a reason to push for another poll on breaking up Britain. ‘We will be pursuing policies which can change things for the better for people right across the UK, such as in health, where we will oppose any attempts to further privatise England’s NHS, ensuring more public funding for healthcare north and south of the border,’ she writes. Campaign trail: The leader of the Scottish National Party is applauded by former leader and local candidate Alex Salmond during campaigning in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire yesterday . ‘I can also give an absolute guarantee that this Election is not about independence or about delivering another referendum, no matter how many SNP MPs may be returned to Westminster in May.’ But Alistair Darling, who led the campaign to save the Union last year, today warns voters not to believe her claims. In his first major contribution to this year’s Election campaign, the former Labour Chancellor says an influx of SNP MPs at Westminster would turn Scotland into ‘Neverendum land’. Also writing exclusively in today’s Scottish Mail on Sunday, he says: ‘Nicola Sturgeon will decide when to hold another referendum and it will be when she thinks she will win it ... [The SNP] need to spell out what exactly they intend. The vote was clear. What’s more, most Scots do not want to live in Neverendum land. ‘We are now told that the General Election is not about independence. Really? 'That’s what the SNP said in 2011 in the Scottish elections. It was all about health and education, they said. Not after the result it wasn’t.’ Revelation: It was also claimed this weekend that Ms Sturgeon has privately vowed to keep voting down an Ed Miliband Budget until he agrees to her party’s policy demands . It was also claimed this weekend that Ms Sturgeon has privately vowed to keep voting down an Ed Miliband Budget until he agrees to her party’s policy demands. With polling experts saying that Labour has only a 1 per cent chance of forming a majority Government in its own right, the SNP’s support is likely to be vital in passing any Budget drawn up by a Miliband administration. Until now, it had been assumed Ms Sturgeon’s party could not vote against a Budget without triggering a vote of no confidence and another General Election. But SNP sources told the BBC’s Newsnight that since the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this is no longer the case.","Tories will be hoping to scare floating voters with puppet-master image .

103,"Amazon has pulled a controversial computer game where players are encouraged to feed a cartoon character battling anorexia. The game is based on children's favourite Whack-a-mole but instead of hitting the mole with a mallet players are invited to throw food a the cartoon girl. It was marketed by SmartTouch media and sold on the Amazon and Android platforms until it was withdrawn following a string of angry complaints. Rescue the Anorexia Girl was available to download on Amazon until they removed it following complaints . If the player misses the girl, she starts to lose weight until she eventually dies. According to the game's instructions, which have now been withdrawn: 'It’s your time to become a real hero with this new amusing game Rescue The Anorexia Girl! 'You know, heroes are not just superheroes, flying in the skies, throwing rocks and fighting villains with supernatural powers. Anyone can be a hero, if he is willing to help others from the bottom of his heart. Start saving the day now!' Gamers have to throw food at the girl who appears in one of nine holes before she disappears again . The game's designers continue: 'Anorexia is a serious disease and fatal if not cured in time. When you have anorexia, the desire to lose weight becomes more important than anything else. For example a girl from new Rescue The Anorexia Girl game has started to renounce meals and even tasty cakes cannot save the situation. But now you have come, brave hero and you can save her. We believe in you!' However, social media users reacted with horror when they first saw the game on the internet. Kelly Bradley said: 'You don't throw air at someone with cystic fibrosis, so don't throw food at someone with anorexia.' Others claimed the game further stigmatised people suffering from a mental illness. Brian Cuban, who suffered from eating disorders wrote on his blog: 'The science of eating disorders is firm. They are biologically based and not a choice. Simply feeding “anorexia girl” isn’t going to cure anything; . 'Eating Disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness.

104,"Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season. His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'","Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Rangers' tough run-in could mean they miss out on second place in the Scottish Championship to Hibernian .

Revellers in the remote village in Jharkhand state tie themselves upside down onto a wooden pole that hand hangs just feet above a raging fire. Seconds later they throw themselves into the flames. Locals believe that the unusual practice helps protect the village from drought and disease, adding that criticism over the safety is misguided and there are no reports of those taking part ever being injured. Unusual: Villagers, including children as young as 10, roast themselves over the open fire in the hope it will bring them good luck . Show of strength: Locals believe that the unusual practice helps protect the village from drought and disease, adding that criticism over the safety is misguided and there are no reports of those taking part ever being injured. The annual fire festival lasts for 11 days and sees dozens of participants dangle over the flames while a Hindu priest uses oil to stoke the blaze as he chants religious hymns. 'It is done to protect the village from natural calamities like famine, drought, and spread of deadly diseases. It brings good luck to the village,' said Arun Nayak, 16, one of the participants. 'Anyone between 10 and 65 years of age is eligible to participate in the ritual,' he added. 'We are not scared. My parents and friends have been doing it for years now. No one ever has been hurt...,God Shiv and Goddess Parvati watches over us,' the villager went on to say. Mr Nayak said he enjoys the thrill of hanging over the fire and feels proud to be one of the participants. The ritual, locally known as Chutiya Manda Puja, is organized every year to 'protect the village from natural calamities and epidemics'. Burn: Revellers in a remote village in Jharkhand state tie themselves upside down onto a wooden pole that hand hangs just feet above the fire . Raging: Seconds later the participants throw themselves into the flame while a Hindu priest (left) throws oil to intensify the inferno . An ardent participant, 52-year-old Munna Kirkey, said that participants have to adhere to a strict diet to prepare for what is known as Agni Pareeksha, meaning trial by fire. 'We start consuming Bengal gram and jaggery sorbet 10 days before the trial starts and stay away from sinning,' Mr Kirkey said. 'Hanging over the fire is the ultimate test of our austerity...If participants don't follow the rules they will vomit during the fire test and may even get burns,' he added. However, Mr Kirkey pledges that so far, there has been no such incident. Those who pass the hanging fire test are eligible to proceed on to the next state - to walk on ambers. Raju Sahu, 40, who has been participating in the ritual for last 40 years, believes the ritual is important for the betterment of the community. 'If we don't perform the rituals anything can happen. In my lifetime I have never missed to participate and my children will follow me,' says Sahu.

Devotees from all over eastern India flock the venue. Baffled on-lookers gather around the fire to catch a glimpse of participants performing this 'miracle'. The villagers claim the festival is being celebrated from thousands of years, however they say now the duration has been trimmed because of rapid urbanisation in the area. 'In fact, they have also made amendments to the ritual. Earlier a participant was hanged with an iron hook inserted into his flesh, which now has been replaced with tying with a cloth,' said one of the villagers who had come to watch the ritual. Vijay Kumar Sahu, 63, who has been organising the festival for the past 52 years, also fears that there had been too many changes made in the ritual. 'People are making it easier now and follow only what suits them. I fear this ritual would gradually be phased out or at worst invite god's wrath,' said Sahu.","Locals in the remote area of Jharkhand state believe the ceremony has the power to protect their village .

106,"For most people a hangover will have them reaching for the painkillers and greasy breakfast, but those living in ancient Egypt had a rather different approach. Historians have discovered a 1,900-year-old hangover cure written on an ancient Egyptian papyrus. Written in Greek, one of the medical recipes offers advice for how to tackle a 'drunken headache' - with the leaves of a shrub called Alexandrian chamaedaphne, or sometimes Alexandrian laurel. The text recommends stringing the leaves of the evergreen plant, also called Ruscus racemosus, together and possibly wearing it around the neck. This  papyrus was found in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, and contains a medical 'recipe' for treating a hangover . While the text recommends this as a way of relieving headaches brought on by alcohol, it is not known if it had any effect. The treatment was discovered as part of an ongoing effort to translate the Oxyrhynchus papyrus - more than 500,000 documents found in an ancient rubbish tip at the Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus, about 100 miles south of Cairo. Oxyrhynchus lies south west of Cairo and is considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt. It has yielded a huge collection of papyrus texts from the Ptolemaic and Roman periods of Egyptian history and among them are fragments of plays and the Gospel of Thomas. The city was built around a system of canals and inhabitants dumped their rubbish at nearby sand hills, including lots of written material as Oxyrhynchus was governed bureaucratically by the Greeks and the Romans. Archaeologists have discovered tax returns, census material, receipts, letters about religion, politics, military action and diaries, giving them a thorough picture of everyday life. In 1896, two young excavators - Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt - from the University of Oxford began to excavate the site and combed through the rubbish. While they were concerned with finding works of high literature, they realised the importance of the discarded everyday material. Some 500,000 papyrus fragments are now kept at the university's Sackler Library; among them the account of match fixing. The hangover treatment was one of 24 new medical texts that are the latest to be translated - the 101st volume of translations to be published. Among the documents, researchers at the University of Oxford and University College London have found 11 copies of known medical texts by Galen and Hippocrates alongside the new medical texts. They also found four documents that appeared to be doctors notes. Dr David Leith, a historian and research fellow at the University of Exeter who translated the medical papyrus, said: 'The remedies appear to cross what we might see as the boundary between magic and medicine - and although some ancient doctors disliked making use of ""magical"" remedies, this was far from always the case.' The recipe for drunken headache - kraipale in Greek - read: 'For drunken headache: wear leaves of Alexandrian chamaedaphne strung together.' Dr Leith said: 'The plant name literally means ""ground laurel/bay"", and its leaves are often compared to bay leaves in ancient botanical literature.' The papyrus were discovered during excavations at Oxyrhynchus in 1890 by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt from Queen's College at the University of University. Around 10 per cent of the papyri have been found to be literary and many are private documents, codes, registers, official correspondence, tax records, bills, leases, horoscopes and inventories. Alexandrian chamaedaphne, sometimes called Dane racemosa (above) was recommended as a cure for hangovers in Egypt 1,900 years ago by stringing the leaves in a garland that was hung around the neck . Dr Margarent Mountford, a papyrologist at the Egypt Exploration Society, which owns the papyrus texts, said: 'These texts are hugely important as they give us an insight into daily life at the time. 'Some were copies of ancient Greek medical texts but there were some original medical texts - which look more like magical spells in some ways. 'The hangover cure for example involves handing a laurel around the neck. I have my doubts if this would have worked but perhaps it had more of a placebo effect.' Professor Vivian Nutton, a historian at University College London who was one of those taking part in the translations, described them as 'the largest single collection of medical papyri to be published.' Hundreds of thousands of texts written on papyrus were found at Oxyrhynchus during the excavation (above) The papyrus are owned by the Egypt Exploration Society and kept at the Sackler Library at the University of Oxford. The medical documents all date from the first century AD to the sixth century AD. These images of some of the medical papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus contain descriptions for treating eye conditions, fever and haemorrhoids with surgery . It is thought the hangover cure may have been necessary as many ancient societies drank wine rather than water, which was unsanitised. The newly translated medical texts also include recipes for helping to halt the spread of ulcers, others for treating hemorrhoids, toothache, gangrene and a dozen for treating eye conditions. One recipe describes the need to rub a decapitated ant onto a stye. Another for treating a discharge of mucus from the eyes called rheum, uses a mixture of copper flakes, antimony oxide, white lead, washed lead dross, starch, dried roses, rain water, gum Arabic, poppy juice and a plant called Celtic spikenard. Another gruesome text explains the technique for eye surgery to treat someone whose eyelid had turned inside out. While fragmented, it still makes unpleasant reading. It says: 'the eye... i began... by the temple... the other from the temple... to remove with a small round-bladed knife... the edge of the eyelid from outside... from within until I scooped out.' Dr Leith said many of the recipes could have been written out like prescriptions for people to follow. He said: 'We tried to give a good selection of different types of medical text in the volume. 'For example there are scholarly commentaries on famous medical writings, surgical texts, handbooks for students giving definitions of medical terms, treatises on acute diseases, as well as instructions on preparing perfumed oils - which could be used for medical purposes - and medical recipes. The documents were found at the ancient town of Oxyrhynchus, in Egypt  around 100miles (160km) form Cairo . 'One of the fragments contains a detailed description of the surgical procedure for removing haemorrhoids, though the author emphasises that in operating on the patient one of the haemorrhoids must be left untouched. 'Two others offer in-depth discussions of different kinds of fever and their treatment. 'It’s natural to assume that most of these Oxyrhynchus papyri will have been bought or copied by doctors too for their own use. 'On the other hand, some of the medical recipes may have been copied out by ordinary individuals, so that they could have particular remedies to hand for themselves or their families.' This papyrus is an example of texts discoverd at Oxyrhynchus and features Euclid's Elements of Geometry . Ancient Egyptians would did not have modern hangover cures and used strings of leaves instead, according to new translations of 1,900 year old texts found at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt. Image above posed by a model . The longest medical papyrus ever found is the Papyrus Ebers (pictured). It contains more than 800 treatments for eye problems to digestive disorders . Texts found on the site of Deir el-Medina identify a workman on the crew designated as the 'swnw', or physician. The physician was given an assistant and both were allotted days off to prepare medicine and take care of colleagues. This physician would have most likely treated the workmen with remedies and incantations found in his medical papyrus. These texts acted like a reference book for the ancient Egyptian medical practitioner, listing individual treatments for different ailments. The longest of these ever found is called Papyrus Ebers and contains more than 800 treatments covering eye problems to digestive disorders. The source of the papyrus is unknown, but it was said to have been found between the legs of a mummy in the Theban necropolis. A suggested treatment for a condition that had symptoms similar to asthma is listed as a mixture of herbs heated on a brick so the sufferer could inhale the fumes. Another treatment, this time for intestinal worms, required the physician to cook the cores of dates and a desert plant called colocynth together in sweet beer. He would then have sieved the warm liquid and gave it to the patient to drink for four days. While smearing a paste of dates, acacia, and honey to wool and applying it as a pessary would be used as a form of contraception by the worker's wives.","Hangover treatment found in documents uncovered at Oxyrhynchus, Egypt .

107,"John Helm was commentating on Bradford City’s game against Lincoln City when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day. Here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze. It was a day I have often tried to forget, but it was the one I must always remember. Approaching the 30th anniversary of the Bradford City fire, it was inevitable I would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match I was commentating on for Yorkshire Television. What I did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident, as Martin Fletcher has done with his book Fifty-Six, the Story of the Bradford Fire. The tragic fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind — any bitterness would be understandable — but from everything I have been told there isn’t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately. On the contrary, I remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started. Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire. This corroborates what I was told at the time by the coroner. He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man, visiting this country from Australia, but his name was never revealed. Without making allegations against the club’s chairman at the time Stafford Heginbotham, there is inference by implication in the book — with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased Heginbotham. As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day, and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later, it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson. I find it abhorrent that Stafford Heginbotham’s family are being subjected to this unseemly inference at a time when people are still grieving and paying their respects three decades on from the most horrendous day of their lives. There isn’t a shred of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy. It should also never be forgotten that Heginbotham twice saved Bradford City from extinction. As son James said to me: ‘He put that club above everything else, including family and business.’ A memorial at Valley Parade pays tribute those who died  in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago . We all have our memories of a day that still sends a shudder up my spine. I cannot bear to watch the footage. If I hear my voice describing the tragedy as it unfolded I have to leave the room. Many of the 54 Bradford and two Lincoln fans who lost their lives, choked to death with inhalation of fumes. The smell was of acrid tar. As a Bradfordian myself I knew many of those fleeing for their lives, as I attempted to describe the scenes without becoming over-emotional. Thirty years on we try to forget but we must always remember. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","John Helm was commentating on the game the day the fire broke out .

108,"Saracens breathed a huge sigh of relief on Tuesday night as Billy Vunipola was cleared of intentionally headbutting Mathew Tait — leaving the No 8 free to face Clermont Auvergne in Saturday’s Champions Cup semi-final. An RFU disciplinary panel dismissed a charge that Vunipola had recklessly led with his head in a incident which left the Leicester full back prone on the ground following a clash last weekend. Saracens are the last remaining English club in the competition and would have appealed against the decision if their in-form England star had been banned. Billy Vunipola trains in the spring sunshine on Tuesday as Saracens prepare for Saturday's clash . The England No 8 had been cited for striking Leicester full back Matehw Tait with his head . ‘As a club we have respect for the disciplinary processes which are in place but at the same time we are surprised,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall on Tuesday before the verdict. ‘He’s been charged with a strike to the head. It’s got to be intentional but everyone can see that it isn’t. There are enough camera angles to see that Billy’s eyes stay firmly on the ball. ‘If it’s not intentional, the next argument is “was it reckless?” But Billy is decelerating into the contact. ‘He’s in a great driving position and his feet are in contact with the ground. There’s no recklessness involved. It was just an accidental clash of heads.’ Vunipola and his team-mates appear to be having fun in training as he awaited the RFU verdict . Leicester’s Vereniki Goneva received a one-week ban for striking Saracens flanker Kelly Brown in the same game. Meanwhile, Saracens are considering picking exciting 20-year-old forward Maro Itoje in their back row alongside Vunipola.

109,"It may be another 149 days until England begin their World Cup campaign against Fiji at Twickenham, but England assistant coach Andy Farrell can already feel the excitement building across the country. Stuart Lancaster’s side will take on the South Sea Islanders in the World Cup curtain-raiser on September 18 at England HQ in a tournament that will encompass 48 matches spread across 44 days of action. ‘Rugby is going to be the sport of the year with the World Cup coming up,’ said Farrell. Andy Farrell says rugby union is going to be the sport of the year with the World Cup coming up in England . ‘It's as though the tournament is going to start in a few weeks’ time. If it’s already like it is now, I think we'll never have seen anything like it come World Cup time. The important thing on the back of that is obviously seizing the opportunity for the legacy after it. ‘I've absolutely no doubt that this is going to be the biggest World Cup ever. You go to places like Gloucester or Exeter; you see the buzz around the place because they know it's coming. It's going to be fantastic.’ England came within six points of claiming the RBS 6 Nations following their pulsating 55-35 victory against France on the final day of the championship – as Ireland secured a second successive title on points difference. It was the fourth consecutive time that England had finished second in the championship, but Farrell saw plenty of positives with international rookies like Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson and George Ford impressing throughout while established campaigners such as Ben Youngs and Billy Vunipola looked rejuvenated. ‘Coming into the World Cup, we're in a great place,’ Farrell explained. ‘There were a few injuries before the Six Nations and people got their opportunity. A lot of people took those opportunities. We're fortunate now that when we pick a 31-man squad; all these guys will have had some experience at international level. ‘Not just experience, but in pressure situations like the French game for example. We’re certainly going to have a squad full of people that can certainly cope in this environment.’ The England assistant coach says England are in great shape ahead of the tournament this summer . England will begin their preparations for the tournament with a two-week training camp at Pennyhill Park in early July. The squad will then embark on a trip to Colorado in Texas for a fortnight of high-intensity training at high-altitude before returning for three warm-up games against France (twice) and Ireland prior to the tournament. England must name a 31-man World Cup squad by August 31 and Farrell admits that some tough selection calls lay ahead. ‘The first train-on squad, we could pick up to 50 players. There'll be good players disappointed that they've not got into that squad! ‘Imagine taking it down to 31 - there's going to be a lot of players, good players, missing out on what is dream playing in a home World Cup so it's a big thing for us selection because you've got to get it right… it's so important. ‘We're together for at least three months before the competition starts which will hopefully be seven weeks long for us so it's a hell of a long time together so we have to make sure that we break it up.’ It doesn’t get any easier once the tournament begins as England will look to qualify from a group that also contains Test heavyweights Australia and Wales. England missed out on the Six Nations title despite an impressive victory against France . Farrell (right) says Stuart Lancaster (left) has some tough decisions to make in terms of selection . Home advantage may prove decisive and Farrell cites the Twickenham factor as a major fillip for his side ahead of the tournament. ‘Obviously, Twickenham's our home. It's a bit of a fortress for us. We play very well here. The crowd always gets behind us. They are the 16th man. We've been fortunate over the last three years. You can't actually nail your hat on which was the best atmosphere now because there's been so many of them. ‘The New Zealand game, all the Welsh games, the Irish games or the last game here (against France) - they're all pretty special. Following their meetings with Fiji, Australia and Wales at Twickenham, England will play their final Pool A game against minnows Uruguay at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. And Farrell, who was born and bred in Wigan, is thrilled that England are venturing out of the capital during the tournament. ‘It's going to be great for us to get up north because there's a lot of northerners in our side anyway,’ Farrell added. ‘It'll be great to get back to our roots and show the people of Manchester what it's about as well. We want to feel the buzz around the whole country behind us not just people down here.’ Farrel says the home crowd will be vital at Twickenham at the World Cup .

111,"UEFA have set a potentially dangerous precedent by ruling that the final 18 seconds of England Women's U19 European Championships qualifier against Norway will be replayed after a refereeing mistake. The Elite Round Group 4 qualifier will be restarted at 9:45pm at Seaview stadium in Belfast on Thursday with the match resuming with England retaking a penalty in the 96th minute at 2-1 down. England's 3-1 Group 4 victory against Switzerland on Thursday afternoon means the Young Lionesses will qualify for the European Championships if the penalty is scored and the match is drawn 2-2. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier in Belfast . Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute . Leah Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway . Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box . Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner . German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month . Jenna Dear scored twice at the Seaview Stadium while Leah Williamson, who is set to take the last minute spot-kick against Norway, earned some practice as she scored past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot from 12-yards. Norway are second in the group following an impressive 8-1 win against Northern Ireland, but crucially have a slightly inferior goal difference meaning the spot-kick will give England a place in the European Championship finals in Israel. The astonishing decision has been taken for the first time in a UEFA competition following an FA appeal after the referee had wrongly denied England the opportunity to retake the penalty during Saturday's match following encroachment. England midfielder Williamson thought she had equalised after slotting the ball into the bottom-right corner but team-mate Rosella Ayane had entered the box too early and German referee Marija Kurtes disallowed the goal. However, instead of ordering it to be retaken, 28-year-old Kurtes - who was named Referee of the Year by the German Football Association (DFB) in 2014 - wrongly awarded an indirect free-kick to Norway. According to the laws of the game, a penalty should be retaken if it entered the goal after encroachment by team-mates of the player taking the kick. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday . April 4 - England 1-2 Norway (Match to be replayed from 96th min on April 9 at 9:45pm) April 4 - Switzerland 1-0 Northern Ireland . April 6 - Norway 2-0 Switzerland . April 6 - England 9-1 Northern Ireland . April 9 - Switzerland 1-3 England . April 9 - Northern Ireland 1-8 Norway . A scene of apparent confusion followed England's wild celebrations as Kurtes explained her decision. Williamson had grabbed back the ball to retake the penalty and placed it on the penalty spot before realising an indirect free-kick had been awarded. Two Norwegian players then embraced as they celebrated the decision. A UEFA statement read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has ordered the match to be replayed. 'The replay of the match should be carried out as follows: . 'The match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the Football Association at the European Women's Under-19 Championship 2015 match between England vs Norway played on April 4, 2015, and extended according to the discretion of the referee. 'The penalty kick shall be retaken by the Football Association. 'According to the Laws of the Game (Law 14), a team-mate of the player taking the kick infringes the Laws of the Game: . - the referee allows the kick to be taken . - if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken . - if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred . 'As the ball entered the goal, the kick should have been re-taken. Thus the CDEB ordered that the remaining time of the match should be replayed in accordance with article 6 (e) and 7 (2) of the disciplinary regulations. Williamson scored from the penalty spot during England's 3-1 victory against Switzerland on Thursday . Jenna Dear (right) scores with a header as England inched closer to European Championship qualification . 'The match is scheduled to take place at the Seaview Stadium in Belfast on Thursday at 9:45pm local time with another referee. 'Teams must field the same players which were on the pitch at that moment. Any of these players can take the penalty kick.' An FA spokesperson said: 'After England Women U19s' match against Norway on Saturday, April 4, the FA lodged an appeal to UEFA following a disallowed penalty. 'Due to an incorrect application of the game's laws by the match referee, UEFA have ordered the match to be replayed from the point of the penalty. 'The remainder of the match will be played on Thursday at 9.45pm at the same stadium – Seaview, Belfast.' Williamson is congratulated by her England team-mates after scoring past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot . Former Everton and England captain Mo Marley is head coach of the national women's U19 team . Although it will only last 18 seconds, officials, stewards and paramedics will all be required to attend. Admission is free. England, coached by former national captain Mo Marley, were 2-0 down to Norway on Saturday before substitute Ayane pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point. However, Wiliiamson's penalty was disallowed and the match ended in defeat. England brushed off the disappointment on Monday, though, with a 9-1 win against Northern Ireland. Both England and Norway must start the match with the same 11 players who finished Saturday's match. However, a different player can take the penalty. The decision further complicates the already complex qualification process for July's finals after UEFA had announced that Norway had sealed their place. After an initial qualifying round last year, the Elite Round is comprised of six groups of four teams playing at locations across Europe. The six group winners and best-placed runner-up - decided by the best record against the first and third-placed teams in the groups - go through to join hosts Israel at the showpiece event in July. England women's senior head coach Mark Sampson tweeted: 'Difficult circumstances for our @england U19. I have been proud that in challenging circumstances you have conducted yourselves superbly & represented your country with great pride. 'Regardless of final outcome you should be very proud. We are very proud of you.' September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain . Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off.

113,"Tokyo (CNN)On the 29th floor of Roppongi Hills, an upscale Tokyo high-rise full of offices, restaurants and residences, two actors in kimonos sit on a tatami mat and glare at each other as artificial smoke billows around them. It's been a long day of filming ""The Crawler in the Dark,"" a new sci-fi horror movie set in Japan's Meiji era. This movie won't be released in theaters; it's going directly to YouTube. The file sharing website is celebrating 10 years since the first 19-second video ""Me at the zoo,"" was uploaded on April 23, 2005 by one of the site's founders. A decade later, the site gets billions of views every day. And the most popular YouTube channels draw larger audiences than many TV networks. In 2015, YouTube is striving to improve the quality of its content by investing in ""YouTube Spaces,"" like the one in Tokyo, where ""creators"" like Tokyo independent filmmaker JR Lipartito have access to professional studios, training, and many resources once out of reach for low budget productions. ""Having a set, especially a period set like this, is almost inaccessible for an independent filmmaker,"" Lipartito says. ""It really breaks down the barriers."" David Macdonald, who moved to Japan as an English teacher two decades ago, is now the Head of YouTube Spaces for Asia Pacific. ""YouTube is not only cats and dogs on skateboards any more. It's a place for great content. Great high quality content,"" Macdonald says. The Tokyo space is one of five worldwide available for free to YouTube partners, who create content and share ad revenue with the website. ""Helping creators find better audiences, more audiences, and just improve their craft,"" Macdonald says. Anyone can create a YouTube channel. The most popular, 25-year-old Swedish gamer PewDiePie, has more than 36 million subscribers. Many of his videos have a viewership that exceeds popular television programs. YouTube has 300 hours of video uploads per minute. The website wants more of those videos to be polished productions. Japanese film and TV company Toei is partnering with YouTube to encourage more Japanese samurai dramas --  called Jidaigeki. The goal is to attract new subscribers in one of YouTube's biggest markets. ""They're building sets. We have high quality cameras, high quality sets, high quality actors,"" says Bob Werley, one of the actors in ""The Crawler in the Dark."" Werley and fellow actor Masa Hitokawahata hope their higher quality work will appeal to more of YouTube's one billion users. ""It's going to raise the bar,"" Werley says. ""We've seen a lot more people wanting to use [the studio], becoming aware of it, getting excited about it."" If a video goes viral, the financial rewards can be significant.

114,"Tragedy: Carwyn Scott-Howell fell to his death while on  holiday with his mother Ceri Scott-Howell, nine-year-old sister Antonia and brother Gerwyn, 19, in the Alps . The family of a seven-year-old skier killed in the French Alps have paid tribute to their 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and revealed he got lost in woods before sliding towards a 164ft cliff. It is thought Carwyn Scott-Howell may have entered the dense woodland because he thought it was a shortcut to his hotel in the ski resort of Flaine. He was on holiday with his mother Ceri Scott-Howell, nine-year-old sister Antonia and brother Gerwyn, 19. Carwyn's parents, ex-nurse Mrs Scott-Howell and husband Rhys, a former butcher, rent out self-catering cottages and run a farm. They bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'. Carwyn would help feed cows and pigs on the farm which has won prizes for its speciality sausages and has sold scotch eggs to Prime Minister David Cameron. His family last night said his death had left them feeling 'utter devastation' with a 'vast void in our hearts', adding that he was 'a very competent skier' who had started aged three. A statement released through the Foreign Office  said: 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky'. Last night, the family, from Talybont-on-Usk, near Brecon, Wales, remained in the Alpine resort of Flaine – a 38-mile drive from Chamonix – in free accommodation provided by the hotel. They are expected to leave today. Police sources said the boy's body may be expatriated today after final post-mortem examinations yesterday. The family were enjoying the last run of their trip in perfect conditions in the town of Flaine when Antonia fell over and her mother stopped to help her. Within moments Carwyn, who friends say modelled himself on survival specialist and TV presenter Bear Grylls, is believed to have taken the chance to go skiing in nearby woodland. Trbute: Carwyn Scott-Howell's family called the 'caring' boy 'daring and determined' after he was killed after falling from a cliff while on an Easter skiing trip to the French resort of Flaine . He skied 100 yards off-piste, where trees were just a yard apart. Unable to weave through, he took his skis off and is thought to have started sliding on his bottom or running. Last night, there were reports Carwyn could have been trying to get to his hotel, Les Terrasses d'Eos, which can be seen from the ski slope. He continued 400 yards, until he plunged off the side of the mountain and fell 164ft. It is believed he landed on a rocky ledge. In a statement released to the Foreign Office, his family described Carwyn as a 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and a 'very competent skier and snowboarder'. They said they were enjoying their last ski run together when Carwyn's sister 'lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead'. 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky. 'Carwyn was a very competent skier and snowboarder who had started skiing at the age of three and spent several weeks each year skiing. We had spent the most happy ski holiday together in the French ski resort of Flaine.' The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day on Friday afternoon. 'The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead,' it said. 'The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts. The family would like to thank all their friends and family for their support at this time and the vast help from the British Consulate. 'The family now ask for time to grieve in private.' Scene: Carwyn's family are believed to be staying in this hotel, close to the slopes where the seven-year-old died . Family: The youngster lived on a farm near Brecon, which is well known for its produce. Here Prime Minister David Cameron buys scotch eggs from Carwyn's father Rhys at the Royal Welsh Show last year . After a search spanning two hours, a rescue helicopter spotted Carwyn's body. As the vehicle was unable to land, crews were winched down to reach the boy, who was declared dead at the scene after 7pm. Michel Ollagnon, police commander from nearby Bonneville, said Carwyn was found wearing his glasses, dispelling reports he went into the woods because he did not have them on. Despite initial reports that Carwyn's mother had let him try the last run of the day alone, Mr Ollagnon said: 'In fact…he went up with his mother, sister and brother. 'The sister fell, the mother stopped and the little boy went off…Why he went in that direction, we do not know … One thing is sure, the skis were found quite a way from the cliffside.' Pierre-Yves Michau, the judge heading the investigation into Carwyn's death, said the inquiry was still trying to verify all the circumstances surrounding the incident. He said: 'The mother last saw her son at about 4pm. She returned to where they were staying because she thought he had returned on his own to the resort. But he wasn't there so she returned to the mountain. Accident: The Welsh schoolboy is believed to have got lost in the woods pictured here, before falling to his death from the cliffs below . Carwyn, who friends say modelled himself on survival specialist and TV presenter Bear Grylls, is believed to have taken the chance to go skiing in woodland to get back to Flaine, pictured . 'She asked everyone if they had seen him. It was about 6pm when she spoke to the pisteurs because she thought he had returned on his own.' He added: 'He had left the piste and then was in the forest and he took his skis off because perhaps the snow was not very good. 'He descended. He continued on foot. Between the piste and where he fell it would have been about 15 minutes. 'There are footprints in the snow after the point where the skis had been left for several tens of metres.' Family friends in Brecon yesterday paid tribute to the boy. One said: 'Carwyn loved exploring. That's what he spent all his time doing. 'He was a little adventurer. He was quite fearless really. He'd always be out in nature.' Another friend added: 'He idolised Bear Grylls and loved spending his time in the woods … He'd grown up in the mountains and [was] used to those kind of conditions, which makes this awful accident all the more tragic.' Holiday: Carwyn's family has said 'the most happy ski holiday' in Flaine, France, turned to tragedy after Carwyn became detached from the group on the last run of the day . A worker at Flaine hire shop Ski Set, who gave her name as Charlotte, said: 'The slope is about 40 metres [131ft] wide. 'You would have to really try to come off the piste … The trees are about 1.5 to two metres [6ft 6in] high. He must have had to push through … It seems he could see the hotel from where he was standing and tried to get there on foot.' The family were well known at food fairs and farmers markets and Carwyn would often help out on their stall. The Prime Minister briefly met Carwyn's father Rhys at the Royal Welsh Show last year when he bought Scotch eggs. A spokesman Mr Cameron said: 'This was an incredibly tragic accident and the Prime Minister's thoughts are with Carwyn's family.' Local farmer Peter Davies said: 'They were a great family not to mention great farmers who made really good sausages. It's just so sad to think what they must be going through right now. The whole farming fraternity is praying for them.' Children and teachers at the school Carwyn attended faced a difficult first day back after the Easter break. Officials at Ysgol Y Bannau in Brecon said a tribute was paid to Carwyn at a special assembly. Headteacher Emyr Jones said; 'The school mourns the loss of one of its pupils, Carwyn Scott-Howell - a lively and likeable pupil who will be greatly missed. 'We at Ysgol y Bannau, as an extended community, the staff, pupils, parents and governors, extend our deepest sympathy to the family; our thoughts and prayers are with them.' A book of condolence has also been opened at Brecon Cathedral, where a picture of of Carwyn in a karate suit was placed next to candles lit in his memory.","Carwyn Scott-Howell, 7, died on a family holiday in Flaine in French Alps .

115,"A Mayfair mansion that was once the site of a milking parlour has gone on the market for £25million. The four-bedroom property in central London's Farm Street has all the trappings of modern luxury with an indoor swimming pool, gym, lift, cinema room and roof terrace. One hundred and fifty years ago however it was used to house cows for milking on one of London's busiest trading streets. Originally used as a milking parlour, it  became a depot before being knocked down in the 19th Century. In 2011 developers took over the site and demolished the house to make way for the plush mansion which now sits in its place. At 8,139 square ft, it is on the market for £25million. A newly-built mansion that was constructed on the site of a former milking parlour in Mayfair has gone on the market for £25million . The house is decorated throughout with modern furnishings and plush carpets. Among its features is a private lift and guest cloakroom . A grand piano sits in the marbled hall on one of the floor's houses. A 14-piece dining table is also featured in the luxury dining room . An indoor swimming pool now takes the place of what once would have been a milking shed in the 18th and 19th Century . A cinema room is one of the many modern features in the property. It was built in 2011 after developers knocked down the original structure . Impressive artwork throughout the house adorns its walls. It is being sold for £25million by estate agents Wetherell and Knight Frank . An opulent 14-place dining table is found on the first floor of the luxury property which also has its own lift . London's milking parlours date back to Tudor times, with Farm Street serving as hub of agricultural trade for years. Cows were brought there from the grazing areas of Peckham, Holland Park and Hampstead heath and sold to local butchers. Alongside the parlours was an abattoir and pub, the Punch Bowl, which remains. Guy Ritchie and Madonna bought the pub while they were married and it quickly became a celebrity favourite. Mr Ritchie sold it in 2013 to the Alexander Langlands Pearse. Inside the modern mansion are four bedrooms including a master suite which occupies the entire second floor. The lower ground floors feature a swimming pool complex with mosaic-lined pool, steam room, gym, shower and changing facilities, kitchenette, guest cloakroom and media room. It also has a private lift, marble flooring, a sweeping spiral staircase and a dining room which can seat 14. Speaking of the property, Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'This recently built house is an outstanding example of contemporary living in historic Mayfair at its very best. 'As the location of Mayfair’s dairy, the interesting and unusual history allowed for the construction of a house on a commercial depot site, without the usual restrictions of historic listing controls. 'The result is an open flowing family house providing spacious rooms and generous ceiling heights rarely found in historic Mayfair.' The house has four bedrooms which all come with their own en suite bathrooms and is set over four floors. It was built in 2011 . One of the four bedrooms in the house is finished with sleek white, grey and black furniture and soft furnishings throughout .

Part of its tiles have been replaced with glass exposing the leisure complex beneath . The luxury home also has a steam room adorned in shimmer silver mosaic and several outdoor spaces for residents to take in sun . A sweeping sun terrace on the building's roof where residents and guests can take in views of the historic Mayfair village . A sleek white and brown kitchen leads out to a sun-trapped patio on one of the house's floors. There is also a kitchenette elsewhere . An aerial view of the staircase shows the house's four floors, with golden sculptures found on shelves the whole way down . A fully-equipped gym has also been installed in the basement of the house and even has a flat-screen TV fitted on a wall of mirrors . High quality finishings are seen throughout the property which is found in one of London's most exclusive areas .","The former milking parlour on Mayfair's Farm Street has four bedrooms, an indoor swimming pool and roof terrace .
