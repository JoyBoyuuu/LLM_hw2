1,"A former Royal Marine killed fighting Islamic State extremists was last night described as a ‘one-man army’ who was ‘very angry about the Middle East’. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by atrocities carried out by IS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults. Scroll down for video . Last message: In the video message Mr Scurfield says he was in Syria of his ‘own free will’ and had gone there ‘to help’ Konstandinos Erik Scurfield (kneeling) pictured with Jordan Matson (second from right), a former US soldier . The Marine’s family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated at being told of his death on Monday. In a statement, they said: ‘His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.’ Last night video footage emerged of the Afghanistan veteran in Syria wearing combat gear, jeans and a black T-shirt. Speaking to the camera he says: ‘My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.’ It also emerged that he was questioned by police last October on suspicion of going to Syria to fight jihadists. On camera: Mr Scurfield introduces himself to the camera before giving a short message explaining why he has gone to fight Isis . Mr Scurfield (pictured), one whose fellow-fighters said he 'gave his life combating terrorism for his nation' He was preparing to fly from the US to Turkey after contacting a Kurdish group on Facebook. He was returned to his unit in Arbroath, Scotland, but decided to leave the Armed Forces before Christmas so he could travel to the war-torn region to fight. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine. He had been training with the US Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline. But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities. His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined. The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of Islamic State, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland. It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. Mr Scurfield, known as Kosta to his comrades, is the first Briton to be killed while fighting Islamic State in Syria. The former drama student, who had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines aged 21, was described by his comrades as ‘Kosta’s one-man army’ who raised the morale of fighters. John Foxx, who served alongside him in a team of foreign fighters nicknamed the Chappies, said: ‘He was hands down one of the greatest human beings I have ever met. ‘From beginning to end he was 100 per cent about helping everyone else. ‘No matter what the issue was or who you were he would try to help you however he could.’ Last night a fellow Royal Marine said: ‘He was very angry about the Middle East and the Islamic State. ‘As a unit we had been on standby several times but nothing happened and he was frustrated that the UK was standing back. ‘He was a very focused and good Marine, but the Islamic State was his priority.’ While back in the unit he became ‘tired of seeing what IS were doing to people’, and decided to quit to join the Kurdish Peshmerga after befriending fighters in the region on Facebook. Mr Scurfield left his UK base in November, telling his parents and three siblings that he was going to provide ‘medical and humanitarian support’ as an expert in battlefield medicine. Fellow fighters in Mr Scurfield's 'Lions of Rojava' group have posted tributes to him online today . Mr Scurfield was described by family friends as 'strong-willed', with a 'deep sense of duty and honour' A pro-Kurdish campaigner says he has informed Mr Scurfield's family of his death. They said last night they had not had official confirmation. Pictured: Mr Scurfield . Konstandinos Erik Scurfield died while fighting with the Kurdistan People's Protection Units (YPG) in the Al-Hasakah province on Monday . But last night details emerged from soldiers fighting on the frontline in Syria that painted Mr Scurfield as a hardened warrior desperate to help the Kurds defeat jihadists. 'We are devastated to confirm the death of our son Konstandinos Erik Scurfield in Syria where he went to support the forces opposing Islamic State. 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.' Mr Foxx added: ‘He would always volunteer to be on the ambush team, spend the night on the berm [defence fortification] or go on any assault.’ Jordan Matson, a former US soldier also fighting with the Kurds, paid tribute on Facebook to Mr Scurfield, describing him as a ‘disciplined warrior’. He added: ‘Kosta volunteered for every attack and guard duty opportunity. He wanted nothing more than to bring the fight to the enemy.’ In recent weeks his father, archaeologist Christopher Scurfield, and his mother Vasiliki – a writer and teacher – became increasingly concerned and contacted their MP for help. Neighbours of the family, Mary-Jane Hemmings (left) and David Miller (right), paid tribute to 'Kostas' today . The Lions Of Rojava boast: 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.' They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists. Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds. Jordan Matson, the former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight. The Lions of Rojava (pictured) are a group of foreign fighters dedicated to fighting and defeating ISIS . Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora. Last August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. Dan Jarvis, Labour MP for Barnsley Central, said: ‘They came to me a few weeks ago very worried for their son’s safety and tragically it appears their worst fears have been realised.’ He said the young man had been ‘horrified by the atrocities carried out by IS’. Mark Campbell, a pro-Kurdish rights campaigner, who broke the news to the family, said: ‘It was very, very emotional, she was literally in tears for the whole conversation.’ He said the Peshmerga wanted to bury Mr Scurfield as ‘one of their comrades in arms, as a hero’. The Royal Marines were understood to have been ‘upset’ that he had chosen to fight with the Kurds rather than the British military. David Cameron’s official spokesman yesterday warned against British nationals travelling to Syria to fight. People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters sit in the back of pick-up truck in the town of Tal Hamis in Syria. Mr Scurfield was fighting alongside the YPG .

2,"(CNN)In the two years since ""Lean In"" became a best-seller and sparked countless conversations about gender equality, author Sheryl Sandberg says she has gotten one question over and over from men: What can they do? Now the Facebook chief operating officer is giving them some specific answers by aligning with one of the most popular athletes on the planet. If LeBron James is encouraging men to lean in for women, don't you think some of his 19 million Twitter followers will get the message too? That's certainly what Sandberg and her LeanIn.org colleagues are hoping, following their brand new partnership with the National Basketball Association and the Women's National Basketball Association and the creation of a public service campaign called #LeanInTogether. In a 30-second video of NBA and WNBA all-stars, we see James of the Cleveland Cavaliers holding up a poster, which says ""All-Star Dad."" Dwayne Wade of the Miami Heat says, ""When men lean in, everyone wins,"" and then touts how he leans in for his wife, mother and grandmother. ""Help women aim high,"" says Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks. The significance of the message and the men who are relaying it is twofold, says Sandberg. To truly bring about equality at home and at work, men need to be part of the discussion, and we need to bring the discussion to where men are, she says. Sheryl Sandberg at BlogHer: Not every woman has to be a CEO . ""The conversation about equality has long existed by women, for women, in women's forums where women are, and that will continue, and that's important. But bringing it to the center of the court, bringing men to the center of that conversation -- people like LeBron James and Steph Curry (of the Golden State Warriors) and Dwayne Wade, saying 'I'm in for equality and here's why' -- I think that could be transformative,"" said Sandberg in a phone interview. What Sandberg and LeanIn.org are also hoping to do is show men specifically what they can do, providing a series of tips about things they could start doing at home and at work, and as managers, as soon as they finish reading this story. Many of the suggestions might seem like common sense to many women -- such as male managers giving women credit in meetings and men sharing 50-50 in household and child care duties at home. But Sandberg says with the list of ""simple, clear, everyday things, practical things"" men can do that are based on real data, men will see not only how they can help but how they individually will benefit. For instance, research shows that boys and girls with a more involved father are healthier, mentally and physically, happier, have stronger emotional attachments and relationships, are at lower risk for substance abuse and are more successful at work and at home, Sandberg said. For girls, there's an extra benefit, she said. By age 14, if a girl sees her father doing child care and housework, her concept of the array of things she can do professionally is much broader than that of girls who don't see their fathers doing household chores, she said, pointing to a study by the University of British Columbia and published in a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. ""The way men react when you tell them children of more active fathers of any income level, no matter how active a mother is, do better -- a lot of men, particularly those with wives who are home (and who say) 'I'm covered. My kids are in good hands' ... they are motivated,"" said Sandberg. Despite 'Lean In,' workplace equality remains abysmal . Dads might think they are doing all they can by telling their daughters they can be anything they want, but if Mom is still doing all the cooking and cleaning, their girls aren't getting the full message. ""What really matters is seeing what you do. You have to walk the walk. She needs to see equality to believe it."" Another huge goal, Sandberg says, is showing men they won't lose out in the workplace when there is more equality in the executive suites and in boardrooms. ""If you've long been in the majority and long held power, and you see change, you could naturally be nervous that this wasn't going to help you,"" said Sandberg. Men need to realize it's not a zero sum game, she said. ""When companies do better, there are more jobs, more promotions, more salaries for everyone. When companies do worse, there's less for everyone,"" she said. She mentioned a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, which found that if women were in the workforce at the same percentage as men in the U.S., our country's gross domestic product would grow by 5%. ""We haven't seen 5% GDP growth in a long time. ... That's a lot of jobs for a lot of people, so understanding that this is beneficial for everyone, I think, is huge."" Work-life balance not just a women's issue . Sandberg's #LeanInTogether comes as emphasis seems to be growing on getting boys and men to think about gender equality. Sandberg will be one of the opening night speakers at a four-day conference on engaging men and boys that begins Thursday in New York. The conference is sponsored by The Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at Stony Brook University. In January, a U.N. conference sponsored by Iceland and Suriname, which I was honored to attend as a panel participant, brought together ambassadors, other policymakers, and athletes and artists, with the goal of changing the discourse among men on gender equality. An overriding message repeated at the conference was that we can't keep telling men what to do. We need to show them what many men are already doing every day at home and at work. ""Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads . That is why the recent focus on caring dads in ads during this year's Super Bowl was so applauded by men like sociologist Michael Kimmel, who is spearheading this week's New York conference on men and masculinities. ""This provides a counternarrative to all the action hero, buffoon images that we see,"" Kimmel told me when I talked to him days before the Super Bowl. Kimmel said very few men, fewer than 10%, can relate to the way the media depict masculinity, according to a study conducted by Dove Men+Care. Kimmel was hired by the brand as an adviser to help analyze its research. Men today are spending far more time doing housework and helping with child care and are enjoying more egalitarian relationships than any generation in American history, and their ideas about what it means to be a man have begun to shift as well, said Kimmel, who is the author of more than 20 books including ""Manhood in America: A Cultural History."" Sandberg says we need to recognize and support the new definitions of masculinity and hopes the message from stars like James and Wade goes a long way toward doing that. ""I am increasingly convinced that unless we fully accept men as caregivers, we can't fully accept women as leaders,"" she said. ""We've got to stop calling it 'Mommy and me.' As long as we are calling it 'Mommy and me,' we are communicating to women that this is their job ... and we have to do both sides of this."" Admittedly impatient about gender equality (I'm impatient too!), Sandberg concedes we have a long way to go until the gender equality problem is solved and LeanIn.org can close its doors. ""We have been fighting for equality for too long,"" she said, noting that women starting earning about 50% of college degrees back in 1981. ""Thirty-four years is plenty of time to get 50% of the top jobs, and we're not close. We're at 5(%) in the Fortune 500. And so we have to change, we have to change more. We have to get more people involved."" Enter King James. Do you think NBA stars like LeBron Jones and Dwayne Wade can help encourage men to 'lean in'?

3,"A pair of conjoined twins born sharing a tailbone and genitals will have to undergo a lengthy operation to be separated. The twin sisters were born on 17 March at Ningdu Hospital in Jiangxi, China. They were delivered via caesarean section after their mother's blood pressure dramatically increased, the People's Daily Online reported. Rare: A pair of conjoined twins born in Jiangxi, China, sharing a coccyx and genitals, will have to undergo a lengthy operation to be separated . The girls' father, whose surname is Zeng, 35, said his daughters were transferred to a Shanghai hospital yesterday after doctors advised him they desperately needed separation surgery. The twins are the man's first children with his wife, to whom he has been married for eight years. A hospital report stated: 'The twins are joined by their sacrococcygeal regions and their genitals. One back passage is blocked and the other is normal.' It added that the twins might die if they are not given separation surgery within four days. The operation could take up to 12 hours. Joined: The twin sisters were born on March 17 and were rushed to the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai yesterday . Expertise: Medical staff attend to the twins as they are transferred between hospitals via ambulance. A hospital report stated: 'The twins are joined by their sacrococcygeal regions and their genitals. One back passage is blocked and the other is normal' A pair of conjoined twins who shared a liver were successfully separated in Kunming, south west China, earlier this month. And at the end of February two ten-month-old conjoined baby girls from Texas survived a world-first operation to separate them. Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata shared the same chest wall, lungs, pericardial sac, diaphragm, liver, intestines, colon and pelvis. Care: The report added the twins might die if they are not given separation surgery within four days. Above, they are carefully carried into hospital while wrapped in a huge red blanket . Concern: The twins are Zeng's first children with his wife, who he has been married to for eight years. Above, the 35-year-old climbs into an ambulance . A team of more than 26 clinicians, including 12 surgeons, six anesthesiologists and eight surgical nurses at the Texas Children's Hospital operated to separate the girls. The 26-hour surgery was the first time twins conjoined at the chest and abdomen in this way had been successfully separated.","Twin sisters were born on March 17 at Ningdu Hospital in Jiangxi, China .

4,"Their faces covered in elaborate black patterns and, in some cases, totally dark with ink, these smiling villagers are some of Burma's last surviving tattooed women. A custom that, according to legend, began when an ancient king tried to make slaves of the women, the inkings were first intended to repel incomers and then became a symbol of beauty. But with  younger people increasingly reluctant to be inked for fear of ridicule and for fear of the heavy fines imposed by the ruling military junta, Burma's tattooing tradition is on borrowed time and could disappear within a generation. Sign of beauty: The women of the Chin, Magan and Muun tribes say facial tattoos are a sign of beauty . Customs: The tradition exists alongside other customs such as playing the flute through the nose. A Magan woman is pictured. Isolated: The tribes live far from the Burmese capital Naypyidaw in a mountainous area that was cut off until two years ago . Fines: The military junta has done its best to eradicate the tattoo tradition and levies a hefty fine of half a cow on anyone who gets one . Meaning: Each of the facial tattoos is replete with symbols, although the most frequently seen design is the spider's web (pictured) Variation: These women, both from the Chin tribe, have less prominent tattoos than those from the Muun and Magan peoples . Attractive: This lady told MailOnline that her spider's web tattoo caught men like the real thing catches flies . As a result, few women now have the markings, with the majority of those who do living hidden away in the mountainous Chin, Rakhine and Arakan regions - all of which were closed off to visitors until two years ago. Now an estimated 700 tourists travel to the area each year, although few are inclined to attempt the precipitous climb up to the mountain eyries of the Magan, Chin and Muun tribes. Those who do will be rewarded with a warm welcome - and a glimpse into one of Asia's oldest, and most threatened, cultures. Most of the tattooed women boast spider's web designs which, as one villager quipped to MailOnline, 'attract the men like a spider's web catches insects'. Others bear full-face tattoos, with every part of their face covered in ink - again, a symbol of beauty. So popular did the look become, one elderly lady, Pa Late from the remote Kanpelet village, revealed that women who chose not to have it 'looked ugly to all the men'. Must-have: The tattoos are thought to be an ancient custom that arose in response to a slave-hungry king. It was supposed to make girls ugly . Mandatory: In the centuries that followed, the tattoos became a sign of beauty and were insisted upon by parents . Generation gap: Although Ma Aung Seim has facial tattoos, her granddaughter Yi Yi (left) has refused to have them for fear of ridicule . All black: Pa Late, who says her tattoos took three days to complete, says an all-black face was once thought to be the most attractive . Youngest: 67-year-old Miss Heu is one of the youngest women to have the tattoos in Kanpelet. She was tattooed by her grandmother . Delicate: Women of the Chin tribe have smaller and more delicate tattoos that only cover part of the face . Painful: The facial tattoos are made using thorns (pictured) and ink made from a mixture of pig fat, cow bile, plants and soot . Toothless: Many of the women regularly chew betel nuts which results in tooth loss and brown stains on the rest . The tattoos, which are created using thorn needles and an ink made from a mixture of cow bile, soot, plants and pig fat, are also a sign of bravery - particularly those etched on the neck, which are the most painful of all. In the past, women who tried to avoid being tattooed found themselves thrown into the family pig pen where, says Pa Late, they stayed until they changed their minds and submitted to the procedure. Now, however, the tables have been turned on the tribesmen, with the brutal military junta that dominated the country until 2011 declaring the tattoos illegal and imposing harsh fines on anyone to break the rules. Although the country is currently undergoing a political renewal under current president, Thein Sein, the fines remain in place - and as a result, fewer and fewer women are getting the tattoos. Other tribal customs, such as changing a woman's name when she becomes a mother, remain intact, as does a continuing belief in the power of the village shaman and his totems. High on Mount Victoria in a Chin village called Pan Baung, the skulls of pigs and buffaloes sacrificed during shamanic ceremonies adorn each house, while outside, the family totems are arranged in a wooden palisade. Traditional lives: All three tribes live in remote mountain villages and, as a result, are still adept at handicrafts and believe in shamans . Few visitors: The Mount Victoria area in which they live was closed to outsiders until two years ago. Now 700 tourists arrive each year . English: To the tribespeople, all foreigners are 'English' - a legacy from the UK's time as the colonial power in Burma . Pale: They also believe that white skin is the result of boiling the individual concerned in water . Smoke break: Nearly all the women smoke pipes, although their frequent smoke breaks don't seem to affect their ability to move around . Relaxed: Most of the women smoke tobacco in their clay pipes, from which they are rarely parted . No problem: The women's daily routine, which involves heavy lifting and mountainous paths, is seemingly unaffected by their smoking . Hard work: For the Chin, Muun and Magan (Chin pictured) women, life revolves around collecting water and gathering food . Most homes have a small post topped with an egg beside their front doors, which according to local lore, is a way to bring the family good luck and happiness, while also repelling evil spirits. Other Chin traditions include a ban on men eating meat in his wife's family's home in case it brings bad luck and an emphasis on having sons who will, should a family member be murdered, be expected to avenge their death in person. That many of the Chin, Muun and Magan traditions, including, rather charmingly, a penchant for playing the flute using the nose, exist intact only because of the villages' remoteness. Although many villagers have left in search of work in Naypyidaw, the capital of Burma, and in countries such as Singapore, those who remain live much as they always have - without electricity and with sightings of foreigners few and far between. With so few visitors, any non-Burmese to appear in the village is immediately deemed to be English - a hangover from the colonial times. Amusingly, many of  locals remain convinced that white skin is the result that person being boiled. But, as with their tattoos, the future looks uncertain for the Chin and other Burmese tribes, whose traditions are beginning to be eroded by incomers - not least in the non-Chin teachers who teach the children different traditions and a different language. In Pan Baung village only six tattooed women, all of whom are now in their 80s, remain. They truly are the last of their kind. Totems: The people still believe in totems such as pig skulls (left behind boy) and eggs, which are thought to bring good luck and happiness . Family: Wooden totems represent different stages in a family's life. Each is paid for with a buffalo so the more there are, the richer the family . Extra money: Most of the tribes are self-sufficient but make extra money through weaving and basket making . Housework: Women do all the cooking and housework. The tribes say it brings bad luck if men cook . Precipitous: The tribes live deep in the mountains in small villages that cling precariously to the steep slopes . Spectacular: Many live on Mount Victoria (pictured), which is too steep for most visitors to navigate .","The Muun, Magan and Chin tribes of remote north-western Burma consider tattoos a sign of beauty .

5,"(CNN)Lindsey Vonn lifted her crystal globe prize with pride after winning the World Cup downhill title for a seventh time, Wednesday. A crystal ball might be more useful for the American star, who has faced plenty of slippery slopes in her dramatic skiing career. The 30-year-old has twice fought back from a career-threatening right knee injury but this season she has been back to her brilliant best. At the final meeting of the ski season in the pretty French resort of Meribel, Vonn raced to more records on the women's World Cup tour -- a seventh downhill season title and her 18th crystal globe overall. The sparkly spheres are handed out to winners of the World Cup individual disciplines. ""This downhill title probably means more to me than the others because I've been through so much,"" Vonn told CNN's Alpine Edge. ""It means everything to me, this is what I've been working so hard for for the last two years. ""This season definitely got off to a better start than I expected and I've had some ups and downs for sure but to come away with a globe after a long season is something that I'm really proud of, so it couldn't be better for me right now, I'm so thrilled."" Vonn, who credits boyfriend Tiger Woods with inspiring her recovery, fended off the challenge of Austria's Anna Fenninger to claim the downhill crown by 103 points. Despite the softening snow, the American won the downhill race with a fastest time of one minute, 29.87 seconds while Fenninger finished off the pace in eighth. As she crossed the line, she punched the air and screamed at the crowd when she saw she was in first position. After receiving her crystal globe, she celebrated with her team by popping champagne and spraying it over her nearby supporters. Vonn and Fenninger will renew their rivalry Thursday for the super-G title, where Vonn holds an eight-point lead over her challenger. If Vonn wins tomorrow she will equal Swede Ingemar Stenmark, who owns an overall record of 19 crystal globes. ""I'm not thinking about that,"" Vonn insisted with a laugh. ""It's always hard to get titles - it's a long season, and it takes a lot to win the crystal globe but tomorrow I'm just going to be focusing on skiing my best, just as I did today.""","Lindsey Vonn wins record-breaking seventh downhill title .

6,"The starting pistol has been fired on the campaign to pack bars and clubs in Magaluf with thrill-seeking British teenagers this summer. After new lows were plumbed by venues in the Majorcan resort last year, clubs are gearing up for another summer of binge drinking, sun, sea and sex. Clubs linked to the one where a girl performed sex acts on 24 men last July are advertising positions for 'podium dancers' over the coming summer. Meanwhile Carnage Magaluf, the company who organised the now infamous event, is already signing youngsters up for 'unlimited free shots' on £30 'booze cruises'. Scroll down for video . Bars and clubs in Magaluf are playing on the resort's reputation in ad campaigns targeting British teens . Nightclub promoters in Magaluf have begun tweeting messages to bring in youngsters this summer . The Carnage Magalluf firm is even trading off the back of events last summer, tweeting: 'Who's ready for the world famous bar crawl starting in April?' The firm's website is now advertising VIP pool parties, jungle sessions and bar crawls alongside images of a barman pouring spirits into a young woman's mouth in a so-called 'dentist's chair' position. It comes as police on the Spanish island are given new powers to seize drinks from tourists on the street between 10pm and 8am. There will also be tougher restrictions bar crawls and fines for 'balconing' - a craze for jumping off hotel balconies which has led to several deaths. Authorities are also in talks to fly in British police to patrol the streets over the height of the summer season. But those organising the bar crawls have shrugged off the new controls, which they fear could deter youngsters wanting to let loose. Organisers of the Carnage Magaluf bar-crawl, at which a British teenager was encourage to perform sex acts on 24 men last year, have played on their notoriety while others insist new rules will not affect street drinking . Adverts are being sent out adversing cocktails for just one euro (80 pence) in many bars in the resort . The Magaluf 2015 Twitter feed posted a message saying: 'Absolute nonsense about drinking laws in #Magaluf. Clubs still open till 6am, bars open until 4am, some bars open at 6am!' It also posted a photo of bikini-clad girls covered in red liquid with the caption: 'I can't wait to be ashamed of all the things I do in Magaluf 2015', adding 'Don't believe the hype, the Magaluf street drinking ban isn't going to change anything this summer!'. Bars are already advertising their one euro drinks deals - with cocktails called 'f***** hammered', 'scruffy cow' and 'f***** up', described as a 'nine spirit mix', all available for less than a pound. The resort was shamed last summer when a video emerged of an 18-year-old girl from Northern Ireland performing sex acts on 24 men, who lined up in the resort's Alex's Bar. Witnesses said the girl had agreed to perform the sex act after being told by party organisers she would win a 'holiday'. But her prize reportedly turned out to be a cocktail named 'Holiday', made from gin, vodka, peach schnapps, blackcurrant liqueur and fruit juice. Authorities in Majorca have vowed to crack down on street drinking and cheap alcohol after last summer .","Push to get British teens to Magaluf this summer has already started .

A photographer is hitting back at a 'cyber bully' and critics after her photo shoot with a military family featured their baby boy wrapped in an American flag. The image shows Landon Clevenger, at the time eight days old, from Virginia Beach being cradled in an American flag by his father, Rodney Clevenger, who is wearing his U.S. Navy uniform (pictured above) Vanessa Hicks (above), 29, from Virginia Beach posted pictures from the photo shoot onto her Facebook page on March 8, unaware that they would receive negative feedback . However, a community business page on Facebook, 'You Call Yourself A Photographer?' posted Hicks's image of Landon and Mr Clevenger criticizing the use of the flag. The group wrote that the flag is 'not a prop' (the post above) Hicks said her intention was to honor the U.S. flag while also honoring the parents, as Clevenger's wife, Samantha, also served for the country as a former US Army member, and he has served as a sailor in the US Navy for six years, according to ABC News. The family wanted to include their military service in the photos said Hicks. The mother-of-three and Navy veteran who served for four years said the image she took illustrates what Mr Clevenger was fighting for - the American flag. 'I have seen first-hand what is desecration of the flag,' said Hicks of her time in the Navy. 'At the end of the day I didn't do anything that disrespected this flag.' However, a community business page on Facebook, 'You Call Yourself A Photographer?' posted Hicks's image of Landon and Mr Clevenger criticizing the use of the flag. The group wrote: 'The flag is not a prop. I repeat: The flag is not a prop. To use the American flag in such a way is disrespectful, rude, tacky, disgusting, and against the U.S. Flag Code.' It continued detailing the 'key points' of the code including that the flag should never touch anything beneath it. The post concluded with: 'Mr. Clevenger, you have disgraced our fallen soldiers as well by disobeying that code. Hicks said: 'When I look at [the] picture, I see a man who has served six years in our Navy, the mother of this child is prior Army' (above Samantha and Rodney in uniform) Hicks said her intention was to honor the U.S. flag while also honoring the family, as Clevenger's wife Samantha (pictured above with her father, a Navy member), also served for the country as a former US Army member, and he has served as a sailor in the US Navy for six years . 'I don't know what the military teaches these days but I do know my son was taught the flag code and also taught that any disobedience towards that code would result in repercussions from your command....yet here you are in uniform, name fully visible, on a photographer's Facebook page disobeying that code and dishonoring our fallen soldiers and you obviously don't care.' Several Facebook users supported the post agreeing that the 'code was broken and the flag was used as a prop', while others said 'anyone who is offended by this is uptight and ignorant'. One user wrote: 'I agree the code was broken and the flag was used as a prop. And desecrated by pee and poop from what I heard. 'I hold the flag sacred and it is my opinion is has 2 places. On a pole or on the casket of a fallen hero.' Hicks said she spent hours taking down comments from her business and company page criticizing the photo. Several Facebook users supported the post agreeing that the 'code was broken and the flag was used as a prop' (above a user slams Hicks's use of the flag in the photo shoot) On Facebook, she posted earlier this week writing that she almost let the negativity take her down, but then decided to take a stand and fight back. She wrote: 'Yesterday, I woke up to see this photo was shared on a group site that is meant to bash other photographers. It was in their opinion I had disrespected our nations flag. I had disrespected our country by taking this picture. 'Several of these people not only bashed the picture, but me, saying I should be ashamed of myself, my husband should be ashamed, etc and I received several private messages to my business page. 'They even took it a step farther and bashed the service member in the picture, hoping he gets in trouble for participating in desecration of the flag.' The photographer who is married to an active-duty Navy member announced that she has since offered the Clevenger family free photo shoots for life from her company as a way to thank them for their support (the Clevengers above) On Facebook, Hicks posted earlier this week writing that she almost let the negativity take her down, but then decided to take a stand and fight back. She has since received overwhelming support from those including military members who said the picture was not offensive (above a former solider shares appreciation for the photo) Hicks said that she believes the picture of Landon and Mr Clevenger shows what it means to be American (above a Navy member writes that those offended by the photograph are 'up tight and ignorant') Do you find this photo of a baby wrapped in an American flag by his sailor father disrespectful? Do you find this photo of a baby wrapped in an American flag by his sailor father disrespectful? Now share your opinion . Hicks added: 'I almost let these cyber bullies get me yesterday. I could have easily deleted the picture off of my business page and ended it with that. I almost did. Then I thought, why? 'These cyber bullies would win! Hell no! So I went to the group and I stood up to them. I stood up for what I believed in! And you know what, so did so many others!' Hicks said she has since received overwhelming support from those including military members who said the picture was not offensive. A user wrote in support of Hicks photo: 'It brought tears to my eyes. I am a former Soldier of the 82D Airborne Division, I cannot think of anything more perfect, to describe what fighting for your country truly means, than your picture. 'It is the embodiment of patriotism. I know the friends I have lost would think exactly the same thing. Thank you for your beautiful work.' Hicks said that she believes the picture of Landon and Mr Clevenger shows what it means to be American, according to WTKR. 'When I look at this picture, I see a man who has served six years in our Navy, the mother of this child is prior Army,' she said. The photographer who is married to an active-duty Navy member announced that she has since offered the Clevenger family free photo shoots for life from her company as a way to thank them for their support.","Vanessa Hicks, 29, from Virginia Beach took photo of eight-day old Landon Clevenger with US flag cradling him 'to honor his military parents'

8,"Dramatic pictures have emerged of the moment Harrison Ford was carried away on a stretcher following his terrifying plane crash. The 72-year-old's face is seen covered in blood with his neck firmly strapped into a brace as he his wheeled from the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles on Thursday. First responders are also pictured wrapping bandages around his head before taking him away. He deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground, breaking his pelvis, when the engine failed while flying solo. Scroll down for video . Bloodied: Harrison Ford is carried away from the scene of his plane crash on Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles on Thursday . Keeping vigil: Calista Flockhart was seen leaving the Los Angeles hospital after another lengthy visit with her husband who broke his pelvis while crash landing his vintage plane on a golf course . Emergency care: The 72-year-old's head is seen covered on bandages and his neck was put in a brace as he was wheeled off of the golf course and into the back of an ambulance . Response: The Indiana Jones and Fugitive star was then taken to hospital where his wife, Calista Flockhart, is staging a bedside vigil . Ford's wife, Calista Flockhart has stayed close to his side at hospital. The 50-year-old actress emerged on Friday night appearing tired and emotionally drained following a bedside vigil that lasted several hours. Calista was seen at the wheel of a black Lexus pulling out of the hospital parking garage with an older male companion in the passenger seat. The former Ally McBeal star looked like she hadn't slept in a while, her face make-up free and eyes dark-circled and bleary from possible crying. Her light brown hair hung limply around her face and her manner of dress appeared simple and casual as though she'd grabbed the closest clothing in reach. Calista looked like she needed sleep and was perhaps heading home to recharge for a spell with the intent of returning to the actor's side soon. Wrapped up: Paramedics unroll bloodied bandages around the actor's face. He deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground when the engine failed while flying solo . Treatment: Ford's arm is seen flung across his chest as he is treated by first responders. He broke his pelvis during the crash in his vintage plane . Cautious: He is gently rolled onto his side by members of the fire department as he is placed on a stretcher . On Thursday afternoon, Ford received a visit in hospital from his wife, who was seen looking emotional in her car. A doctor has revealed Ford was moaning in pain, slumped over in the cockpit, when he landed. 'He was stunned a bit,' said spinal surgeon Sanjay Khurana. 'He was moaning and in pain.' 'It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his 'Star Wars' films. So, it was obvious,' Khurana told ABC News. A video has since emerged of the moment the plane started to drop. As Ford descended, the people playing golf at the time were captured on film gaping open-mouthed at the sky before running out of the way. Dr Khurana was golfing next to Santa Monica Airport when he saw the plane 'belly flop' and rushed to the fairway where it came to rest. He told TV stations in Los Angeles and GMA that aside from worrying about Ford's injuries from the impact, he saw fuel leaking out of the World War II-era plane. Patrick Jones, an official with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), told reporters in Venice, California that investigators were inspecting the wreckage as well as reviewing documents pertaining to the upkeep of the plane. 'The aircraft will be examined, the engine will be examined, the records of the aircraft will be examined and ultimately we'll submit a factual report,' Jones said. 'All of that process is going to take probably a couple of weeks to a month or so,' the NTSB official said. The final report probably will not be out for a year.' Impact: A doctor has revealed Ford was moaning in pain, slumped over in the cockpit, when he landed . Support: The injured actor is surrounded by first responders as he is taken away on a stretcher . Jones said that the plane being as old as it is in many ways makes the investigation more straightforward. 'This aircraft is a fairly simple aircraft,' he said. 'A lot of it is old-school mechanical. We'll see what it is, we'll look at everything.' Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, flew out of Santa Monica Airport in the Ryan PT-22 Recruit when he experienced engine trouble just minutes into the flight. He was trying to return to the airport when he crashed. Authorities said they have not yet had the opportunity to interview Ford, but plan to do so over the course of their probe. The actor suffered multiple gashes to his head and was left bleeding after the crash. A family spokesman said Ford's injuries were not life-threatening. His son Ben, in a tweet late Thursday, said his father was 'battered, but OK.' Downed: Investigators surround the plane's wreckage. The National Transportation Safety Board say the probe into the crash could take up to a year . Probe: Investigators are examining the wreckage and documents pertaining to the upkeep of the plane in order to determine what happened . Scene: Golf bags surround the crash site in the aftermath on Thursday. Many players on the course at the time rushed to Ford's side when the plane went down . Tired and emotionally drained: The 50-year-old actress appeared understandably distraught . Support system: Calista was accompanied by a silver-haired male companion . Heading home: The weary-looking Calista was perhaps heading home to recharge before making the drive back to hospital . In good hands: Harrison Ford, 72, was last listed in fair to moderate condition in hospital . Fuel leak: The injured actor was pulled from the wreckage as the smell of gasoline filled the air . He and other golfers pulled Ford from the wreckage. Others threw dirt on the fuel so it wouldn't catch fire. Along with his friends who were golfing, Dr Khurana pulled Ford from the wreckage as the smell of gasoline filled the air. 'We wanted to get him out safely and with the fuel leaking out, I motioned to some of the other folks at the golf course to put dirt on the fuel so it wouldn't combust,' he said to CBS News. 'I just wanted to get him out safely so that the situation wouldn't erupt into a fire.' On Thursday, a teary-eyed Calista was seen looking emotional while heading to hospital to visit her husband Harrison in hospital. She had a handkerchief pressed to her nose and her eyes appeared to be tinged in red. Saved: Dr. Sanjay Khurana, who had been golfing when Ford's plane crashed, later said, 'It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his Star Wars films'","The 72-year-old is taken to an ambulance with his neck in a brace .

9,"A paleo diet guru who wrote a controversial cookbook with My Kitchen Rules judge Pete Evans has hit back at critics after it was revealed she performed voice-overs for junk food commercials. In a statement released on Tuesday, food blogger Charlotte Carr argued she never 'personally' endorsed the products she spruiked in advertisements for Cadbury, Coca Cola and KFC. The revelations came just weeks after publisher Pan MacMillan dumped her controversial cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, after public health experts expressed alarm over a DIY baby formula recipe in the book. 'I am a working mother and like everyone else, will do everything I can to keep my family safe and nurtured,' Ms Carr said today about her decision to do voice-overs for the junk food brands. 'If I'm telling you through advertising on television or radio to buy a certain car, or catch a certain airline, or use a certain toothbrush, I may not drive that certain car, or use that airline or use that toothbrush.' Charlotte Carr (pictured) has worked as a voice artist for a number of leading brands. She has written a paleo diet book with My Kitchen Rules judge Pete Evans . Food blogger Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of 2008 Australian Idol winner Wes Carr (right with son Willow), has co-authored a controversial recipe book with MKR judge Pete Evans . In a statement, Ms Carr (pictured on stage) said it was difficult to select individual voice-over roles because she worked as a freelancer and often received offers as a package deal . Ms Carr said it was difficult to select individual voice-over roles because she worked as a freelancer and often received offers as a package deal. She said she was talking to her agent about choosing 'roles that align more closely to my values'. Ms Carr, Mr Evans and nutritionist Helen Padarin are forging ahead with plans to independently publish their controversial cookbook in a digital format next month. The book has copped heavy criticism from dietitians and health authorities, with the president of the Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA), Heather Yeatman, quoted saying 'a baby may die if this book goes ahead'. The PHAA said its DIY baby milk formula, which is based on liver and bone broth formula, contained excessive amounts of Vitamin A. In an interview about the book with the That Paleo Show podcast, Ms Carr said there had been a 'censorship issue' with the recipe. 'I think we need to look at possibly where the comments have come from and who sponsors those organisations,' she said. 'It's a very, very big issue here. 'It's also a censorship issue, you know? This has been promoted and printed I know it's well over 500,000 times because the (inaudible) manual has been printed that many times already. 'And it's in many, many other books across the world.' 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers' will be published independently online. Pan MacMillan Australia will not publish the book after concerns were raised by health experts . 'As a hard working mum to my beautiful baby boy Willow, and like most Australians, my family are my highest priority and will always be', Ms Carr said in a statement . 'Paleo Pete' Evans has become one of Australia's leading spruikers of the paleo diet . A spokesman for Pan Macmillan Australia would not comment on censorship claims. 'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum – The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' he said in a statement. Public Health Association CEO Michael Moore told Daily Mail Australia the real issue was that specific diets discourage parents from breastfeeding. 'If adults want to use a paleo diet, even though it's rated amongst the worst diets of the world, then so be it,' he said. 'When you start talking about specific diets for infants... It discourages from breastfeeding and there's huge amounts of research around the world that breastfeeding's best.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said authorities recommend that parents use commercial infant formulas if an infant is not breastfed. She said the paleo formula is also concerning because it contains one-tenth of the calcium of breast milk, 879 per cent the sodium of breast milk, and 168 per cent the selenium of breast milk. 'These are important nutrients to get right in the diets of babies,' the spokeswoman said. As a hard working mum to my beautiful baby boy Willow, and like most Australians, my family are my highest priority and will always be. I often have little control over the jobs that are contracted to me as a voice over artist, like so many freelancers in my field. I am frequently presented with a package rather than specific clients that I can pick and choose from. Over the years as I have become devoted to eating and living a specific way, due to the health concerns of my family, I have been working with my agent to choose roles that align more closely to my values. I have never ""personally ""endorsed any of these products since becoming a holistic health coach and baby food blogger. I am a working mother and like everyone else, will do everything I can to keep my family safe and nurtured. If Im telling you through advertising on television or radio to buy a certain car, or catch a certain airline, or use a certain toothbrush, I may not drive that certain car, or use that airline or use that toothbrush. I originally created this page out of love and kindness and to share my story so that any Mum in a similar position who has been told to put their child on a gluten free and dairy free diet would have a place to come to for inspiration and ideas. When you are told your child can not have these foods, sometimes its overwhelming and scary and you are unsure where to start. Its a lonely place. This is why I created Bubba Yum Yum. A place of fun beautiful, delicious yummy food. With love, X .

10,"A New Jersey man who thought he was building his dream home ended up with a worthless pile of bricks he says has cost him his happiness and all his money. Humayun Akhtar, 66, built the sprawling Florham Park home for him and his wife in 2007. Almost immediately, he says, cracks began to appear throughout the house, which he soon learned was collapsing into its unsound foundations and sliding off the side of the hill on which it was built. Now Akhtar is in a protracted court battle with builder JDN Properties, who he says have left him financially ruined and emotionally broken. This home in Florham Park, New Jersey was meant to be Humayun Akhtar's $1.6 million dream home for him and his wife but substandard construction turned it into a nightmare . 'I used to be a singing, laughing person,' Akhtar told WABC. 'I don't listen to music anymore. I haven't seen a movie in ten years, I can't relax anymore.' Akhtar and his family have not spent a single night in the home, which has buckled so severely that a marble placed on the floor will roll freely without the slightest push. 'I spent all the money I had and I was cleaned out. I have nothing now,' he said. Akhtar successfully won a settlement against JDN Properties in 2011 for $7.4 million on claims the company defrauded him by cutting corners on soil beneath the foundation that wasn't strong enough to bear the house. However, the company recently won an appeal of that decision. JDN Properties argues they tried to get Akhtar to let them repair the home before the damages worsened.

Now the case will be seen before a New Jersey jury, which will decide if JDN Properties knowingly defrauded Akhtar. Meanwhile, Akhtar's attorney David Stanziale told ABC News that the home has gone into foreclosure. 'This whole thing has destroyed my life,' Akhtar said. 'I feel like a fool. Now I have to live 250 years to recover all the money I lost.'

12,"(CNN)Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was hiding an illness from his employers and had been declared ""unfit to work"" by a doctor, according to German authorities investigating what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable pilot to steer his jetliner into a French mountain. Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. The note, Kumpa said, had been ""slashed."" Just what was ailing Lubitz hasn't been revealed. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently 17 days ago, ""concerning a diagnosis."" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. German investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they'll be able to reveal just what they found in the records in Lubitz's apartment in a quiet, suburban neighborhood. They found no goodbye note or confession, authorities said. But the fact that investigators found ""ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,"" prosecutors said. Authorities left Lubitz's apartment  Friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside. According to authorities in Germany and France, Lubitz was a co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 between Barcelona, Spain, and Dusseldorf on Tuesday when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit, then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain. Germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing. The only sounds, authorities said, were those of pounding on the cockpit door, Lubitz's steady breathing and, eventually, screaming passengers. An 8-minute descent to death . Lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant, authorities say. Mother, daughter among 3 American victims . What could have prompted Lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft, killing everyone on board, remained the focus of investigators in Germany. Officials said Lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list, and his religion was not immediately known. He had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013, said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. While the ailment Lubitz had sought treatment for hasn't been revealed, that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail, aviation analysts say. Pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they're found unfit, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. Reuters reported that a German newspaper said Lubitz had been treated for depression about six years ago. Citing internal documents forwarded by Lufthansa to German authorities, Bild reported that Lubitz had suffered a ""serious depressive episode"" around the time he took a break from his pilot training in 2009, Reuters reported. The Bild report said he then spent about 18 months getting psychiatric treatment.  Lufthansa officials and German prosecutors declined to comment on the Bild story, Reuters said. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. It could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit, authorities say. Rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site, but few of them are intact, Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations at Seyne-les-Alpes, told CNN. Dangerous and windy condition at the remote site, which covers more than a square mile, are hampering efforts to recover bodies and evidence, he said. Officials with experience traversing the French Alps are helping technicians who don't have alpine skills, he said. ""Since they don't know the mountains, you need to provide them with equipment, you need to hold them with rope, give them crampons so they can work well and as precisely as possible, so that no evidence, no body part could escape their vigilance,"" Naffrechoux said. Workers are now looking into the possibility of building a road to the site, Naffrechoux said. Recovery teams have made good progress, a French senior paramilitary police official told CNN. Gendarmerie Lt. Col. Jean-Paul Bloy, who is coordinating the helicopter operations for the crash site, said there will be two aircraft deployed over the scene Saturday. There were five on Friday, Bloy said. As that difficult work continued, relatives and friends of the victims traveled on Lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished. They held prayers in Le Vernet, near Seyne-les-Alpes, a village serving as a staging post for the recovery operation. Flowers and pictures sat on the ground, candles flickering in the cold air. Germanwings said it was setting up a family assistance center in Marseille, France, with family briefings to start Saturday. Another flight carrying victims' relatives was due to arrive in Marseille from Barcelona on Friday. ""Our focus in these darkest hours is to provide psychological assistance to the families and friends of the victims,"" said Thomas Winkelmann, a spokesman for the Germanwings executive board. It could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered, identified and released to the families, authorities said. Meanwhile, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a temporary recommendation that cockpits always be staffed by at least two crew members. ""While we are still mourning the victims, all our efforts focus on improving the safety and security of passengers and crews,"" the agency's director, Patrick Ky, said in a statement. Lufthansa and other German airlines have already adopted the rule, the airline said. An official with the German Aviation Association told CNN that it was only a matter of hours, or a day at most, for this rule to be implemented across all big German airlines. A pilot aboard a Germanwings flight Friday morning spoke out at the beginning of the trip to ""reassure passengers that there will be two people present in the cockpit at all times."" Lufthansa will now keep two crew members in cockpits . CNN's Catherine E.

But it's good to have shown mental strength to come back even stronger and prove that critics do not reach me.'

Subs not used: Ward, Roos, Hanson, Thomas, Shotton, Warnock . Booked: Christie . Manager: Steve McLaren 6.5 . Referee: Keith Stroud 3 . Attendance: 27,480 . In the 69th minute goalkeeper Lee Grant elected to punch rather than catch the ball after Craig Forsyth had slashed a clearance skywards. Grant succeeded only in diverting it horribly into his own net. Forsyth was at fault earlier. Three minutes after the interval he erred in sending a clearance to Kevin McDonald, who fed the Nouha Dicko. The Mali striker dispatched his finish through the legs of two Derby defenders. The match was utterly absorbing. Derby hit the woodwork twice, Wolves once. There were shots, saves, and in the 39th minute a real shocker. Amid the end-to-end chances, Stroud intervened in entirely unnecessary fashion. Jesse Lingard slipped a pass to Darren Bent, who was tugged down by Wolves captain Danny Batth as he ran clear. In an instant Tom Ince arrived to pop the ball into the unguarded net. But Stroud had blown to award the visitors a free-kick. He compounded the error by failing to administer a card of any colour despite the foul warranting red for denying a goalscoring opportunity. The Wolves players celebrate after Grant punched the ball into his own net to make it 2-0 . Derby manager Steve McLaren shows his frustration during the Championship defeat on Friday . McClaren, sitting in the stands, ripped the headset from his ear and made his way to the touchline to remonstrate. Growing animated, he was mocked by Wolves fans. ‘Where’s your brolly gone?’ they sang. Craig Bryson fired the free-kick at goal and Tomasz Kuszczak, not for the first or last time, dived to save. The Polish goalkeeper had earlier made fine stops from a Lingard piledriver and a long-ranger by Ince. Ince was targeted by Wolves fans for his England Under-21 withdrawal. ‘Eng-ur-land,’ they chanted. He nearly silenced them in the 25th minute with a curling shot that hit the bar. Wolves were more than competing. In the 27th minute a cross by Dicko was deflected to Benik Afobe whose volley was kept out by Lee Grant. Dicko sent another effort just wide. Bakary Sakho holds off the challenge of Derby County midfielder WIll Hughes . He made no mistake with his goal to send Molineux wild. Derby pressed hard in the second period and Kuszczak produced his finest save by getting his fingertips to Bryson’s sweet drive, diverting the ball onto the post. Wolves hit the woodwork too, when McDonald sent Afobe clear with a long pass. The Wolves striker smacked the crossbar. Grant then gifted the hosts the clincher and Derby’s race was run. Afterwards, McClaren had one thing on his mind. ‘It’s cost us the game,’ he said of Stroud’s decision. ‘He will watch it again and know he is wrong.’ McClaren implements a no-swear policy but admitted he breached it when trying to make sense of the officiating. He spoke to the referees assessor to air his grievance. Tomasz Kuszczak of Wolves celebrates his team's second goal against Derby on Friday night . ‘We try not to complain too much about referees like we see in the game,’ he said. ‘But it is very difficult to keep our humility.’ McClaren believes his side can ‘absolutely’ win all their remaining seven games to reassert a push for automatic promotion. A play-off place is the minimum requirement. He hopes his injured players including Chris Martin, Jeff Hendrick, and George Thorne will all be back after the international break. Jackett wants two points per match in the run-in to reach the play-offs just a season after winning League One. ‘We’re in with a really good shout of being able to take one of those three promotion places,’ he said. ‘We have potency up front and pace that disturbs defenders. ‘When Derby beat us by five (in November), at that junction it looked like a chasm between the two clubs. Derby have been setting the benchmark for quality in the Championship. So for us to be two points behind we’re delighted.’","Wolves beat Derby 2-0 at Molineux in the Championship on Friday .

The 25-year-old Wigan midfielder limped out of training at Gannon Park in Malahide on Tuesday morning with his left ankle heavily strapped, and was immediately taken for a scan.

He thought it might go away, but it's just a bit of a pain across the ankle.' O'Neill will be desperate to have McClean fit for the clash with the surprise Group D leaders with fellow wide-man Aiden McGeady having not played for club Everton since January 31 because of a knee problem, from which he has now recovered, but which has left him short of match fitness.

The 63-year-old, who first worked with McClean during their time together at Sunderland, insists he is yet to pick his team for what could prove to be a pivotal game in the campaign, but admits the former Derry City player has become an important player for him. He said: 'They are all key. We haven't picked the side yet, but James has played exceptionally well for us in most of the games since I have been in charge. Obviously I know him quite well - very well, in fact - and yes, he's a good player for us.' Republic of Ireland's Roy Keane gives instructions during the training session at Gannon Park .

20,"The doomed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was taken on an emotional ‘last farewell’ fly-past of the pilot’s home island of Penang before being deliberately landed on the water and sinking intact thousands of miles away, according to a British pilot who claims to have identified its final resting place. The unusual overflying of Penang is ‘perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator’ he says. The theory of Simon Hardy, a senior Boeing 777 captain with a major commercial airline, has gained support from one of Britain’s top flight safety specialists, David Learmount of the respected Flight International magazine and flightglobal website. Scroll down for video . Missing: MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12.41am on March 8 2014 for an approximate six-hour flight to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew . The unusual overflying of Penang, pictured, where the captain of the lost Boeing is from, is ‘perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator’ Captain Hardy spent six months analysing the flight data of the stricken aircraft, which disappeared almost a year ago with 239 people on board, in a bid to solve the mystery. He has concluded that the search in the vast Indian ocean being conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board (ATSB) is about 100 nautical miles away from the where the aircraft actually is. He also believes the riddle of the aircraft’s odd dog-leg flight path immediately after take-off from Kuala Lumpar is down to the aircraft performing a final ‘fly-past’ of Malaysia’s Penang island to allow someone to have ‘a last emotional look.’ Captain Hardy notes from his research that the captain of the lost Boeing 777-200, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, came from Penang, while First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid was from Selangor. Details are reported in the Sunday Times. Captain Hardy says that after taking off from Kuala Lumpur at 16.41 GMT on March 7 last year, flight MH370 lost contact with air traffic control at a point over the China Sea where four flight information regions intersect. The last verbal contact had been at 19.19 and the captain’s was the last voice heard. Captain Hardy said the flight did something ‘quite remarkable’ by flying in and out of the airspace of Malaysia and Thailand eight times noting: ’I’ve never seen anything like that but it is a good way to cause confusion between the controllers.’ The captain of the lost Boeing 777-200, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, left, came from Penang, while First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid was from Selangor, right . Missing: Searchers scouring huge swathes of the world's oceans for the jet have so far found no sign of it . After flying along the border the passenger jet performed a sharp u-turn towards Penang, one of three turns made in quick succession. 'It took me months to work out what this was. 'The clue was Ayers Rock,’ he said referring to the giant natural feature and landmark in the heart of Australia. 'I have done the same manoeuvre there, to look down and get a great view. Somebody was taking a last emotional look at Penang.’ He explained: ’I thought of this at 5am, went downstairs and researched where the air crew were from.’ Noting that pilot Shah was from Penang while co-pilot Hamid was from Selangor, he said: ‘Someone did a nice long turn and looked down on Penang. It’s perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator.’ Military radar gave the last fix of the flight at 18.22 GMT heading South towards the navigation waypoint Anoko. It then flew straight for thousands of miles before, it is believed, ending up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Australia. Australian investigators believe the plane crashed. But Captain Hardy believes it was deliberately landed on the water and then sank intact close to a trench in the sea – explaining why no wreckage has ever been found. Australian investigators said they had been in touch with Captain Hardy and described his theory as ‘credible.’ Flight magazine’s Mr Learmount said: ‘Since Capt Simon Hardy revealed in Flightglobal/Flight International his calculations about where Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is likely to have come to rest, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau – leading the MH370 search team – has spoken at length to him. ‘Despite worldwide interest in his work, nobody – yet – has suggested his calculations are anything but logical and mathematically sound.’","Theory of Simon Hardy, a senior Boeing 777 captain, has gained support from one of Britain’s top flight safety specialists .

21,"Washington (CNN)The State Department is reviewing Hillary Clinton's emails to determine what can be released to the public, not whether she did anything wrong, according to a senior department official. Clinton aides and department officials stressed this week that the former secretary of state did not violate State policy when she exclusively used a private email account for government work. However, it is currently unclear whether Clinton broke a State guideline dating back to 2005 that suggested ""normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an (authorized information system), which has the proper level of security control."" Those guidelines were filled with exemptions that could allow Clinton to use a private account. The department official was careful to say that the people reviewing the documents are ""not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of Secretary Clinton's 55,000 pages of emails."" Clinton was not automatically in violation of State Department policy when she exclusively used a private email during her four years as America's top diplomat, the source added, contradicting other media on Thursday. ""Under federal regulations, there is no prohibition on using a personal email for official business as long as any records are preserved,"" the official said. ""Reports claiming that by using personal email she is automatically in violation of that FAM [Foreign Affairs manual] are inaccurate."" Clinton's use of private email was never hidden from anyone, according to a former State Department official. The former secretary of state sent thousands of employees message from that account and in her four plus years at the State Department, nobody raised a red flag and say that she couldn't conduct her email communication in the manner she was conducting it, the former official adds. There were no big internal discussion among State Department lawyers, either, about Clinton's use of private email. The former official said it was simply accepted as her form of communication. Clinton's exclusive use of a private email system has quickly ballooned this week into a controversy for the presumed Democratic frontrunner for president in 2016. Experts have said it doesn't appear Clinton violated federal laws, but that hasn't stemmed the issue that has become more about bad optics and politics. Clinton tweeted on Wednesday night that she asked State to release her emails. ""I want the public to see my email,"" her tweet said. ""They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."" The State Department acknowledged Clinton's request after the tweet, and a senior official said the review could ""take several months."" And while State officials said their review will focus on what can be released, the inquiry will also have to determine what is not suitable for dissemination given its sensitivity. If the department has to withhold documents, questions are likely to be raised about whether Clinton broke State Department guidance for transmuting sensitive but unclassified materials. On Friday, Marie Harf, a state department spokeswoman, said she was ""not going to speculate"" about whether there is sensitive information in Clinton's emails. ""We just don't know what would happen in that situation, there are so many variables and factors, I just really don't want to speculate,"" Harf said. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Clinton's closest aides at State were well aware that Clinton communicated using a private email address. ""Neither career foreign service officers nor State Department lawyers suggested that Mrs. Clinton use a department email address,"" the Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the inner workings of State Department under Mrs. Clinton. Clinton's spokesman failed to comment to CNN questions about those revelations by the Times. A senior State Department official did say on Friday that administration officials who engaged in email exchanges with her would been party to the fact she used a private account, although it is unclear how many administration officials she actually emailed. Several Clinton former senior staffers have said they used to get their instructions from her verbally. The questions around Clinton's email use have captivated political watchers over the last week and allowed Republicans to cast Clinton in a similar way they did her husband, former President Bill Clinton: As a secretive politician pushing the boundaries and rules and regulations. Charges of hypocrisy have also surfaced given that an inspector general's report from 2012 - while Clinton was secretary - repeatedly cited Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration's use of ""commercial email for official government business"" saying it was against policy to do so ""except in emergencies,"" which created morale problems, ""confusion and discouragement within the embassy community."" Gration, who resigned his post in 2012 before the IG report became public, was criticized for a number of other things in the document, but it was clear that his using commercial email instead of State Department email was a real concern. At the time, Clinton was using her own personal email account to conduct official business. Clinton set up a server at her home in New York to keep her emails, meaning she and her aides were in possession of the documents, not the State Department. When the representatives from State asked for all her records in 2014, Clinton sent them the 55,000 pages of emails. A Clinton aide said they provided ""anything that pertained to her work"" at State, but it is impossible to verify the former secretary of state did send everything. State Department guidelines require employees who use private email accounts to back up those documents on government computers so that the department can archive them and they can be available for Freedom of Information Act requests. Clinton aides argue that they complied with State rules when they sent the documents to the department, but that did not happen until 2014, over a year after Clinton left the department. In addition to directives from State, federal guidelines from Clinton's four years leading the department do not appear to outlaw the exclusive use of personal email devices. The National Archives and Records Administration, the government agency that regulates the Federal Records Act, issued guidance in 2009 -- the same year Clinton took over at State -- that allowed agency employees to use personal accounts as long as they ensured ""that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system."" Before that, the archives agency said they did not ""specifically address this issue."" It wasn't until 2014 - when President Barack Obama signed an update to the Federal Records Law - that a timeline was set up to mandate how quickly emails had to be turned over by people who used personal devices. David Chalian, Jim Acosta, Brianna Keilar and Chris Frates contributed to this report.","Clinton's use of private email was never hidden from anyone .

22,"Hillary Rodham Clinton's silence on the email controversy swirling around her is getting louder by the day. On Monday, the potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate ignored the issue at a forum while a second Democratic senator urged her to speak out – and predicted she will – about her decision to conduct business while secretary of state in a private email account. Republicans are ramping up their attention on the issue. At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama indeed knew she was using a nongovernment account during her tenure. Obama had indicated earlier that he only learned of that from recent news reports. EMAILS? WHAT EMAILS?

Obama did not know at the time that she was using private email exclusively, Earnest said. Clinton spoke at a carefully choreographed two-hour event involving her No Ceilings project at the Clinton Foundation, highlighting economic and educational opportunities for women and girls. She took no questions. When she sat down to lead more informal conversations with invited speakers, participants appeared to be reading from teleprompters.

Dianne Feinstein of California made waves Sunday when she urged Clinton to offer a detailed explanation. 'From this point on, the silence is going to hurt her,' Feinstein said. On Monday, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Clinton will probably address the matter – and should. 'I think that you're going to hear something from Secretary Clinton this week,' she said on MSNBC. 'I'm fairly certain it will be soon. I think that's very important.' Last week, Clinton said in a Twitter message that she wanted her emails released by the State Department as soon as possible – but did not address why she does not put them out herself immediately. Clinton's spokesmen and the State Department have said she never received or transmitted classified information on her private email account, in which case there would be no concerns that disclosure of her messages could compromise national security. The State Department is reviewing 55,000 pages of emails that she has turned over and Republicans in Congress have said they plan to review her email practices.","The White House now says Obama exchanged emails with Clinton at her private, non-government email address while she led State Department .

23,"'We've got fans on the pitch. The game's still going on'. That's not me making a mess of Kenneth Wolstenholme's infamous words from Wembley in 1966 when the boys in red won the World Cup. That was Jonathan Pearce's spontaneous reaction on commentary when some Villa fans piled onto the playing area towards the end of their team's semi-final at home to West Brom. Of course they were scenes that no one wanted to see. Except that they very nearly were. Because they were a hare's breath from what we saw when Geoff Hurst went through to make it 4-2. Only time surely makes that a less controversial incident? Aston Villa fans invaded the pitch after their FA Cup win over West Brom on Saturday night and are seen taunting the away supporters as a line of police keeps them apart . Thousands stream onto the pitch after the match, which was moved to Saturday evening by the BBC . Geoff Hurst races through to score England's fourth goal in the 1966 World Cup final with West Germany . The FA Cup is a tournament that we were told had lost its lustre. And attendances may well have endorsed that. But this season, with the FA succumbing to the scheduling charms of their new telly twins the BBC and BT, the tournament seems to have taken on a new lease of life. The kind of effervescent and exciting competition in which frequent nostalgic reruns of great Cup days somewhat ironically often includes the sight of fans celebrating on the pitch. Not that that makes that group of Villa fans' behaviour justifiable. Although you might debate that a Midland derby that doesn't kick-off until Saturday tea time could just be asking for such a response? But the timing was because, I can only assume, the slots were preordained for the BBC to include Saturday and Monday evenings. While BT had Saturday lunchtime and Sunday afternoon. And with the Beeb having first dibs on that deal. Or in other words, Auntie had what they'd consider would be the ideal ties, with which to ensure the biggest possible audience, at the best possible times in their schedule.

BT Sport's team of (from left) Jake Humphrey, Paul Jewell, Owen Hargreaves and Steve McManaman with the FA Cup pitchside at Bradford City vs Reading on Saturday . This was a situation BT Sport decided to create a silk purse from. Why hadn't we'd been following this season's giant killers Bradford, a nation had cried, having been caught up in the excitement of what had gone on so far with their exploits? Well, on Saturday lunchtime, BT went free to air to answer that call and show us this season's favourite Davids in action live against the Goliaths of...Reading. OK, not a hell of a mismatch, but Bradford were still a great story. Unfortunately this potential silk purse of a game became something of a pig's ear on Bradford City's pitch. Indeed, such a vision in mud it was, it required the club to provide BT with a strange little turf rug on the touchline to put beneath their shiney plinth. Nevertheless, there it was, an old school FA Cup that we could all watch, for nothing, and keep the momentum going on what was proving to be a vintage Cup season. By way of a precursor for the new Premier League telly deal, this sense of occasion rolled on into Monday night. Again, this was a slot that may have driven the purists mad. Danny Welbeck celebrates his winner for Arsenal against former club Manchester United on Monday night . Scott Sinclair is mobbed by Aston Villa supporters after scoring against West Brom . Not to mention some fans from North London who would have had to make their way back from Lancashire by any means necessary on a school night. But again, if you look at the bigger picture, it was the kind of game that could once again get people excited about the Cup. And a formidable old pro line up of Roy Keane, Alan Shearer, Ian Wright and Martin Keown alongside Gary Lineker all helped ensure that there was indeed the sense that what we were witnessing was an event.

24,"(CNN)Empathy. Confidence. Passion. These are the traits the next police chief in Ferguson, Missouri, will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police. So says Cecil Smith. And maybe he should know. Smith is the police chief in Sanford, Florida, another community rocked by racial tensions and poor police-community relations after the high-profile shooting of a black teenager -- the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin. And if Smith's experience is any guide, it will take ""a lot of prayer and a little goading"" to convince someone to step into the job vacated this week by Chief Thomas Jackson. ""That community, as we see, has been hurting and struggling for some time now,"" he says. And how: . -- The community remains deeply scarred by the events last year, after the August shooting death of unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown by a white Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, and the November decision by the St. Louis County Grand Jury not to charge Wilson, who later resigned. Occasionally violent protests and sometimes heavy-handed responses by police deepened divisions and distrust. -- The police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week's release of a damning Department of Justice report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of Ferguson officials. -- Add to that the obvious fears facing officers following the shooting early Thursday of two police officers only hours after Jackson resigned. The decision for Jackson to step aside was a mutual one between the chief and city, Mayor James Knowles told reporters. He'll get severance and a year of health insurance and will turn the reins over to Ferguson police Lt. Col Al Eickhoff next week. The city will launch a nationwide search for a permanent replacement, Knowles said. ""The City of Ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity.  We are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness,"" said Knowles -- who has himself been targeted by protesters demanding he resign. To get there, it might look to Sanford for guidance. There, trust in the police department bottomed out in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin shooting. While no police officers were involved in the shooting, anger over their perceived failure to arrest the teenager's killer, George Zimmerman, pushed relations in the community to a boiling point, eventually resulting in the firing of Chief Bill Lee. Zimmerman eventually was arrested, and a jury acquitted him. Smith watched the chaos play out from Elgin, Illinois, where he was deputy police chief. A former boss in Illinois suggested he look at the job, so he traveled to Florida on his own time, getting to know the community and learning what divided residents and police. He still isn't sure how to explain why he took the job. ""The first year, I was still wondering, was it a smart move?"" Smith joked. But things are better now, he says. After taking the job, Smith made it a point of spending time ""walking and talking"" in Sanford, building relationships with community leaders and everyday residents. Inside the department, stepped up training in engagement and ethical policing. He also stepped up recruitment of African-American officers. ""One of the things that's going on is we don't have people who look like us in the community,"" said Smith, himself an African-American. He handed out long-delayed promotions. And he even presided over a makeover, enlisting officers to help choose new uniforms. The new chief in Ferguson will likely need to do some of the same things, Smith says. Community leaders and other officials agree. ""We need to deal with the culture issue here to make sure whoever is coming in behind Chief Jackson is not a new face and a new name on the same type of issues,"" Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson Township,"" told CNN Wednesday. ""We need to seriously deal with the culture of the police department and the municipal courts and the way the city is run."" New York police Commissioner William Bratton said there are two issues confronting the heads of police forces. There is the lack of trust on the community's part and the lack of confidence some officers have in their leadership. On the first issue, he said: ""You need to be willing to embrace that there is a need to change."" To police leadership consultant John Vanek, whoever takes over the Ferguson department will need to have the same leadership traits valued in boardrooms across the world -- the ability to form partnerships across organizational lines, to think differently, to turn failure into success and to do it all in a harsh media spotlight. But that's easier said than done. ""There's going to be a lot of hostility in Ferguson for a long time,"" he said. So will the new chief need to be African-American to help defuse the racial tensions roiling the city? Here's the politic answer: Find the right candidate, regardless of race. ""You want to find the best candidate to be police chief,"" said attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented the families of both Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.  ""But diversity is very important. It's very important that the police officers understand the communities, at least want to engage with members of the community they are going to be protecting and serving."" ""There's an old saying in the black community that everybody else is protected and served but we are policed,"" Crump said. ""We don't want to be policed. We want to be protected and served as any American citizen."" CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NYPD commissioner: Chiefs need to embrace need for change .

25,"(CNN)Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and . . . a criminal? A sanitation worker in an Atlanta suburb already served two weekends in jail -- and faced several more until officials relented Monday-- after authorities charged him for doing his job too early in the morning. Kevin McGill, a garbage collector in Sandy Springs, Georgia, had been sentenced to a total of 30 days in jail for violating the city's noise ordinance that states that ""trash collection must be conducted between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m."" He was cited one recent morning after starting work about 5 a.m. McGill said that when he appeared in court, he was ""stunned"" when he learned he'd have to serve time for collecting garbage too early. ""The solicitor said, 'It's automatic jail time,'"" McGill told CNN affiliate WSB. McGill said it was the first time he'd violated the ordinance, but the solicitor ""didn't want to hear nothing I had to say."" ""I was shocked,"" McGill told WSB. City spokeswoman Sharon Kraun said McGill appeared in court with his employer and agreed to a plea deal, which included a 30-day jail sentence. The court said the sentence could be served on weekends, and Kraun confirmed Monday that McGill already spent two weekends behind bars. After news of McGill's punishment went viral, the solicitor's office announced Monday that prosecutors would amend his sentence, saying in a statement, ""The actions of the court with regards to Mr. McGill's sentence for violating the city's noise laws was disproportionate to a first-time offense."" ""As such, the court has amended its sentence to time served and further probation (is) suspended,"" the statement said. Chief prosecutor Bill Riley told WSB that the jail sentence was his idea because, he said, ""fines don't seem to work."" ""The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail,"" McGill said. Still, McGill said being locked up with ""real criminals"" was hard, and so was being away from his family. ""I just want this to be over with,"" he told WSB before getting word of the ""time served"" adjustment. ""I'm away from my family, my wife, and she's got to take care of the two little boys and I have four dogs.""","Kevin McGill was initially ordered to serve 30 days in jail for picking up trash too early in the morning .

26,"Luis Suarez left the field a loser last October in his first ever Clasico but on Sunday night he walked off the pitch a man who had put the league title within touching distance of his team – some way to mark your first ever home game against Real Madrid. ‘That’s why we paid a lot of money for him, he compliments what we already have,’ said Luis Enrique of a performance and a goal that meant even though Real Madrid had successfully subdued Lionel Messi they still lost the game. The Barcelona squad have plenty of players who float like butterflies, but at times over the last few seasons what they have really needed was someone who could sting like a bee – Luis Suarez did exactly that on Sunday night. Luis Suarez celebrates after scoring for Barcelona in his first ever home match against Real Madrid . Suarez gets the better of Real Madrid pair Pepe (left) and Sergio Ramos to score for Barcelona on Sunday . It wasn’t quite the 3-1 win that earlier in the season Real Madrid inflicted on Barcelona – and that could still matter if the two teams finish level on points such is the head-to-head goal-difference rule in Spain – but it was still some performance and some win. And what a difference five months had made. That Santiago Bernabeu Clasico was Suarez’s debut after his Fifa ban for biting Georgio Cheillini had ended. He made an almost instant impact setting up Neymar to score after just four minutes. He then laid another golden opportunity on a plate for Messi only to see it missed and Real Madrid come back into the game and win it 3-1. On Sunday night the impact was not so instant but it was lasting. Luis Enrique will also have made a note of how two other new signings who were both still bedding-in last October were also very important in the win. He had insisted on the club signing Real Sociedad keeper Claudio Bravo and he was outstanding, making brilliant saves from Karim Benzema at both ends of the second half. Jeremy Mathieu, meanwhile, was the unlikely scorer of the first goal. ‘I have been pushing myself to get my first goal for the club and finally it comes in the biggest game’ he said. He was also outstanding defensively alongside an immense Gerard Pique. Suarez is crowded out during his first-ever El Clasico match at the Bernabeu as Barcelona lost 3-1 in October . Defender Jeremy Mathieu celebrates with his Barcelona team-mates after giving his team the lead . Luis Enrique was questioned for requesting the signing of Mathieu – a 30-year-old defender with a €20m price tag was always going to have a hard job convincing supporters but Sunday night’s display will have gone a long way to doing that. For Suarez the convincing had already been done with those two crucial goals at the Etihad that made sure Manchester City were brushed aside by Barcelona in the Champions League. Sunday night’s finishing told supporters nothing they didn’t already know. There is a phrase – ‘mig-toc’ – coined by former Barcelona player and coach Charly Rexach which means ‘half-touch’ and is meant to describe Barcelonaa’s passing game as something one step beyond one-touch. Suarez is congratulated by his team-mates as his goal pushed Barcelona closer to the La Liga title . Suarez has that same speed of touch, not in his passing, but in his finishing. The control and shot past Iker Casillas seemed to be part of one movement that happened far too quickly for the Spain keeper and Real defender Pepe to do anything about. He is not the first to score in his first Nou Camp Clasico. Other big signings such as Gary Lineker, Diego Maradona, Romario, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto’o and Zlatan Ibrahimovic all did likewise. Not all their goals were worth La Liga titles however. ‘There is still an eternity to go’ said Javier Mascherano after Sunday night’s game and while 10 matches is little more than a quarter of a season it is true that so much can still happen, especially as Barcelona must travel to Atletico Madrid and Sevilla before the season ends. But Barcelona are now in control of their own destiny and in Suarez they have someone absolutely determined not to finish second this season as he did last year with Liverpool.","Luis Suarez scored winning goal in victory over Real Madrid on Sunday .

27,"Thoughts of Australia's 2019 World Cup campaign were in the forefront of Michael Clarke's mind when the captain decided to end his one-day career. Clarke has announced that Sunday's trans-Tasman World Cup decider will be his final One Day International. The 33-year-old reached closure on the decision upon realising there was no chance he'd still be leading the side in four years. Steve Smith is yet to be confirmed as Clarke's successor. Scroll down for video . Captain Michael Clarke announces his retirement from his one-day career after the Cricket World Cup final . However, that is expected to happen soon given Smith became Australia's third youngest Test captain during summer when Clarke was injured. Clarke suggested it wasn't fair to talk about who would takeover, but that it was important they had four years to mould the ODI side. 'I was very fortunate four years ago to get the opportunity to captain this one-day team and that was really good preparation for this World Cup,' Clarke said. 'The next Australian captain deserves the same opportunity. 'It really helped me having that preparation ... to build my own team and set my own style up as a captain.'

Clarke arrives for a press conference before his team's training session for the Cricket World Cup final . Clarke had been thinking about the decision for some time but only made his mind up after returning home from last Thursday's semi-final against India. 'I think I got back to my house at about 12.30, (wife) Kyly was in bed and that's when I spoke to her about it,' he said. 'I told my teammates 10 minutes ago. I told the selectors and (Cricket Australia boss) James Sutherland about an hour ago. 'There's no doubt I could keep playing (ODI cricket) for the next couple of years .. but I know I've made the right decision.'

Clarke signals to his bench during the 2015 Cricket World Cup Semi Final match between Australia and India . Clarke will continue to play Test cricket. 'I'm hopeful it will prolong my Test career and that's a priority for me,' he said. 'I don't feel bad about saying I feel that Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. 'I see it as the pinnacle ... I feel like I've still got a lot to offer the Australian Test team as captain.' Sutherland was full of praise for Clarke, adding that his decision came as 'something of a surprise'. 'Michael leaves one-day cricket on his own terms, aiming to finish on an absolute high, in front of a packed MCG as a possible World Cup-winning captain,' Sutherland said. 'Regardless of the result, he will leave the one-day international game as one our greats.' Sunday's title decider will be Clarke's 245th ODI, ending a stellar career that started in 2003 and has netted 7907 runs at an average of 44.42.

28,"A mound of spaghetti sits in a bowl with a heaping of tomatoes. Exactly nine puckered capers and a measly two slivers of anchovy perch rather inelegantly atop the pile. On the side tiny serving of mustard, some slices of gherkin and a wodge of waxed cheese. To wash it down is a cup of pink-strained tea. As last meals go, it's not the most glamorous of repasts. This is what Doomsday Prepper Kellene Bishop, a resident in Utah, US, will eat on the day the world ends. Texan Wayne Martin's last meal is a bowl of Campbell’s chicken and spaghetti soup and a side serving of gourmet cat food. He washes it down with a glass of his homemade white wine which he will use as barter in lieu of money once the apocalypse begins . Wilma Bryant from Missouri will feast on thyme-roast chicken covered in gravy and served with beans. Ms Bryant lives with her daughter and the pair are both diabetic and dependent on insulin. Her meal is juxtaposed against syringes and medical paraphernalia . This stark photograph as well as six others were capured by Brooklyn-based photographer Henry Hargreaves. Mr Hargreaves, who is a self-confessed food obsessive explained: 'In the US alone there are over 3 million people preparing for the end of time, this sub-culture is known as Doomsday Preppers.' He is most famous for his No Seconds series, immortalising the Death Row choices of inmates. The photographer visited the preppers to discuss their menus with them before he created their last meals. 'I connected with some of them to discuss their Armageddon Menu's,' he said. 'They are designed around their religious beliefs, lifestyles, location, health and what they think will work on the heels of the disaster they predict.' He confesses that he expected the series to be more dramatic than the final results he captured, and admits that the preppers might be on to something. 'Initially I expected this to be a rather sensational series but as I spoke to some of the subjects I actually was surprised by the brilliance in their approach. 'They have been able to stand back and see the whole food system from afar and realize in any kind of disaster the food distribution chain is the first thing to break and they don't want to be left vulnerable, if and when it does.' Each photograph is accompanied by text which explains a little bit more about the individual Doomsday Prepper. Using the ingredients the preppers had stocked up on Mr Hargreaves concocted meals he envisioned they would be eating if our current social system collapses. A tumble of insects – crickets, meal worms and grasshoppers – is served with a measly shaving of Parmesan. On the side a salad of sprouting seeds.

Doomsday Prepper Kellene Bishop's last meal: A mound of spaghetti with a spoonful of tomatoes, nine puckered capers and a measly two slivers of anchovy. On the side tiny serving of mustard, some slices of gherkin and waxed cheese . Ms Bishop, whose meal opens the series, is referred to as a self-sufficiency and self-defence educator. A foodie with a vast pantry, her Mormon faith endorses prepping. She doesn't want the experience to change her diet and constantly rotates her food stored, which includes waxed cheese, pickled vegetables, vacuum sealed meats, freeze-dried foods and pasta. The next meal, of thyme-roast chicken covered in gravy and served with beans is shown juxtaposed against syringes and medical paraphernalia. Mr Hargreaves created this dish for Wilma Bryant from Missouri, US. The diabetic mother who is insulin-dependent lives with her daughter who who suffers from the same condition. Their low-carb high protein diet is more out of necessity than choice as they have to avoid raising their blood sugar. The duo, who believe the world will end in a fury of tornadoes, keep live chickens to butcher and store their insulin in a nearby stream to keep cold so it will not turn bad as it only lasts six months. As well as the live chickens, their food stores include beans, nuts, soup and pickled goods. 'I created dishes that they will potentially be eating once the system breaks and they have become self sufficient. Through their choices of these foods I think their personal story comes to life,' he continued. The last meal of New York firefighter Jason Charles who has a huge store of ready-to-eat meals or MRE. He is also stocked up on water in a waterbob, packets of ramen and other shelf canned goods . But some meals are not so elaborate. New York firefighter Jason Charles was an emergency responder in the 9/11 attacks and worries that air pollution will kill us all. His apartment in New York City can he sealed off like a bunker and he uses a Waterbob (emergency drinking water storage) as a bathtub. This prepper's last meal is one of the most basic in the series and consists of a ready-to-eat meal or MRE. The firefighters stocks are more MREs, his waterbob, packets of ramen and other shelf canned goods. Pennsylvania City Council Candidate Josh Wander is an Orthodox Jew who admitted to Mr Hargreaves that due to his kosher diet his 'food choices are uninspiring.' He mainly stocks kosher MREs and his last meal consists of matzo crackers with rice and a food ration bar. In his accompanying text, Mr Wander states that the 'Torah states breaking kosher is acceptable if your life depends on it' and so he keeps a flock of rabbits in case times become desperate. His children are not allowed to name the rabbits as 'they are raised for dinner, not pets'. He believes that terrorist attacks will end the world. A tumble of insects – crickets, meal worms and grasshoppers – is served with a measly shaving of Parmesan. On the side a salad of sprouting seeds. This Spartan offering is destined to be the last meal of John Major of Idaho, US. He is concerned radioactive dirty bombs will be denoted around the US, ending all life. 'Soil is one of the best defences against radioactivity,' the accompanying text states. And so Mr Major buries a bank of over 1.5m sprouting seeds. He also forages and collects insects which form his primary intake of protein, and keep bees for honey and medicine.

Jamila Henry, left, who has been detained in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join ISIS. Her twin sister Jalila in stark contrast is described as a party girl who smokes and drinks . But this week they were involved in an extraordinary case of mistaken identity after Jamila was seized by Turkish security services allegedly en route to join jihadi group Islamic State – travelling on her twin’s passport. Confusion arose in Britain after Turkish authorities named the arrested woman as Jalila – prompting one relative to joke that she was more likely to have ended up in the country after getting carried away after a night of partying. Jamila remained in Turkey last night awaiting deportation hearings to get her back to the UK, where she could face arrest on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. British authorities are not believed to have played any part in her arrest and the decision to arrest her was made by Turkish agents. Daughters of a painter and decorator father and council housing officer mother, the Henry twins were described as ‘popular and polite’ in their youth. It has been claimed that Jamila tried to travel to Syria using her sister's passport, pictured . A fellow pupil at Sellincourt Primary School in Wandsworth, South London, said: ‘They were very nice, friendly, hard-working girls. I can’t imagine one of them ever wanting to join Islamic State.’ But as the twins grew up, they began to head in very different directions. Pictures on Jalila’s Facebook page show her smoking – with joking comments from friends about being a ‘weed head’. Other photos show her in a bar clutching two bottles of drink and going out wearing short skirts and a bikini tops. Her ‘likes’ include reality TV shows and modern musicians and rap stars, including Eminem. In contrast, the only pictures of Jamila show her dressed in a head scarf. Relatives said she converted to Islam a few years ago and they have had little contact with her since. One said: ‘They are identical twins. If it is the Muslim one, it is Jamila. The one who is not Muslim is Jalila. ‘She is definitely not religious and drinks and smokes. Frankly, she’s a bit of a party girl. She’s the kind of person who would get drunk and end up in Turkey.’ Jamila was arrested by Turkish security services as she prepared to board a bus in the capital Ankara. Agents suspect she was trying to travel to the border with Syria. Turkish officials said authorities apprehended the woman based on local intelligence and were not tipped off by British authorities. Messages and images on her mobile phone suggested she was planning to head to Islamic State territory, they alleged.

The 18-year-old, who was only named by his surname Pratt in Chinese media, had travelled from his home state of Ohio across to Jiangshan, a city in Zhejiang province in China, after becoming infatuated with a young woman he had met online. But after getting the cold shoulder from his online ladylove when he turned up, he started drinking and was found suffering from hypothermia and unconscious on the staircase leading down into the Xu River. Scroll down for video . A lovesick American teenager (pictured) almost died after getting drunk and nearly drowning in a river when he was dumped by a young Chinese woman he flew 7000 miles to visit . The teen had met the girl online and promised that he would visit her. After getting the cold shoulder when he turned up, Pratt drank himself unconscious and was found on steps leading down into the Xu River . A spokesman from the Cheng Bei Police Station quoted on Qianjiang TV said: 'He was unconscious and lying in a pool of his own vomit. It looks as if he might have fallen in the water at some stage as his clothes and shoes were soaked. To be honest he was so inebriated, he could easily have drowned. It was only a short distance to the water.' Pratt was taken to a local hospital and after regaining consciousness discovered that he had also managed to lose all of his money meaning he could no longer pay for his hotel room. However after hearing about his hard luck story, the hotel manager decided to let the teenager have the room for free. He admitted to police that he did not know the girl's real name, only her online pseudonym which was Xiaoqian, and he also admitted he had only started talking to her this year. Because she had perfect English and great photographs, he had fallen head over heels in love and had promised to come and visit her. Homeward bound: The American teenager, known only as Pratt, survived his brush with death and is now returning to the United States according to the Chinese . Pratt is pictured here in hospital recovering from his ordeal . Police said it appears the young woman may not have taken him seriously until he suddenly turned up in Xiamen, in Fujian Province, and then went to Jiangshan to meet the girl. Detectives confirmed from his mobile phone that he did try to ring her several times, after which he was told to leave her alone – and his number was blocked. Depressed about the rejection, Pratt had started drinking and was last seen cursing and staggering near Xu River, where he was found passed out later that night. Police tracked the young woman down, but she again refused to meet him despite hearing about the fact that he had almost died. A police spokesman said: 'We followed his progress until he left the country, and he is already on the plane back to the United States.' When contacted, Pratt denied that he had travelled to China because he was in love with a girl or that he was stood up by her.","Lovesick US teen travelled from Ohio to Jiangshan, China, to meet the girl .

Speaking out: Kai Hibbard (seen left and right) has reportedly penned an expose on'The Biggest Loser.' Hibbard finished as the runner-up during the show's third season . A source in the book industry told the Daily News 'The show didn't invent fat-shaming, but exploits it. Her proposal was so juicy. It has a bigger, more important message about weight and health.' According to the newspaper, Hibbard's book claims that 'The Biggest Loser' refused to purchase new underwear for contestants, whose underwear drooped as the pounds came off. The Daily News reported that alleged contestant hook-ups and remarks made by show trainers when the cameras aren't rolling are included in the book. A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment. Hibbard posted a link to the Daily News story on her Facebook page, writing 'Like most things reported in the media, this is *sort of* correct. I hope more than a ""tell all"" that when all is said and done it stands as a statement on the media, society and how shame is not a motivator but a paralytic from someone who has regretfully been there and done that.' Remarks: Hibbard - seen here in an episode from the third season of 'The Biggest Loser' - recently called the program 'a fat-shaming disaster' Hibbard did not  respond to a request for comment. She recently told the New York Post that 'The whole f****** show is a fat-shaming disaster that I’m embarrassed to have participated in.' She also told the Post that '[The trainers] would say things to contestants like, ""You’re going die before your children grow up."" ""You’re going to die, just like your mother."" ""We’ve picked out your fat-person coffin"" - that was in a text message. One production assistant told a contestant to take up smoking because it would cut her appetite in half.' Hibbard also alleged that she suffered health issues, telling the newspaper that 'My hair was falling out. My period stopped. I was only sleeping three hours a night.' At the time, NBC told the Post 'Our contestants are closely monitored and medically supervised. The consistent ""Biggest Loser"" health transformations of over 300 contestants through 16 seasons of the program speak for themselves.'","Kai Hibbard, who appeared on NBC's weight-loss competition 'The Biggest Loser,' has reportedly penned an expose on the hit reality show program .

33,"An Australian entrepreneur who runs a successful coffee shop is being deported - because she didn't earn enough before launching the venture. Australian-born Jacky Collyer, 27, moved to Britain in 2011 and married barista husband Andy Carter, of Swindon, Wiltshire, two years ago. They had just signed a five-year lease on a premises for their own coffee house when they received a bombshell letter from the Home Office. Australian-born Jacky Collyer (right) and her husband Andy Carter (left) set up a coffee shop in Swindon, Wiltshire - only to be told she must return to Melbourne within two weeks . Officials said she must be deported because the couple did not meet the minimum income threshold for sponsoring a non-EU spouse to stay in the country. At the time they submitted their income, Mr Carter was still studying philosophy at Sussex University so their combined salary fell below the £18,000 minimum. Jacky now has just 14 days to return to Melbourne, shattering their dream of running their own business. A number of her customers, and two local MPs, have now joined a campaign to stop her being deported. Her distraught husband said: 'Our whole world has been torn apart. Our family and friends are here. We have a business. We have a cat. 'If we have to go we might try setting something up somewhere else, probably in Europe, maybe in Germany.' Jacky Collyer moved to Britain in 2011 and married barista husband Andy Carter, of Swindon, Wiltshire, two years ago. They are pictured on their wedding day . Jacky moved to the UK in 2011 and met her husband  while she was working in a coffee shop in Brighton. They married two years later and returned to Mr Carter's home in Swindon, where they set up an artisan coffee business. But just days after the couple signed a five-year lease on Darkroom Espresso in July 2014, Jacky received the letter from the Home Office. They fell victim to a new law which came into affect in 2012 meaning someone in her position must have a household income of least £18,600 to stay in Britain. She said: 'We wanted to come to Swindon and set up a business like those in Brighton, and really contribute to the area. 'They seem to think that because we earn a little bit less than £18,000, we'll start claiming benefits. The pair had just signed a five-year lease for their own coffee house when they received a bombshell letter from the Home Office . 'We were told we couldn't possibly live on that much money, but we're perfectly happy with the money we have, we run our own business and still go out for nice meals. 'The weird thing is, my visa requirements say I can't claim state money anyway, so I couldn't even if I wanted to! 'I spent years supporting Andy while he was studying, and then we started our own business. So, of course we don't earn that much money right now.' They appealed the Home Office decision but last week received another letter telling her this had been rejected, and are now facing a lengthy separation and the folding of their business. The letter said she would be required to leave the country by next Thursday, but she has since started an appeal process. She said she had been 'overwhelmed' by the support she had received, but was determined to make sure more people knew about the strict immigration rules. She said: 'Even if I do have to leave, I want people to know about this law. So many people have no idea, and it's so unfair. 'We would have qualified under the old rules and so many people don't know they've changed.' The couple say they have been told that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to a private and family life - does not apply in their case. Mr Carter said he had been told that this was because his wife's immigration status was already seen as 'precarious'. Among the couple's supporters are North Wiltshire MP, James Gray, and Labour South Swindon parliamentary candidate, Anne Snelgrove. She said: 'This is a young couple who have set up a very successful business in the Railway Village which is an area which really needs more businesses like this. More than 2,000 people have signed an online petition in a bid to block Jacky Collyer's deportation . Jacky moved to the UK in 2011 and was working in a coffee shop in Brighton when she met her husband who was studying philosophy at Sussex University . 'I am shocked and dismayed to hear about how the have been treated. 'I will be talking to some of my friends who are MPs and will be trying to find out what can be done.' Darkroom Espresso's most loyal customers have started a Facebook campaign to help and more than 2,000 people have signed an online petition to keep Jacky in the UK. A Home Office spokesman said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with immigration rules. In July 2012 the Home Office reformed the rules that apply for family immigrating to the Britain from non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries. It included the introduction of an £18,600 minimum income threshold for sponsoring a non-EEA spouse or partner to come to Britain or remain in the country. The Home Office said that it introduced the guidelines to prevent 'burdens on the taxpayer, promote integration and tackle abuse' and to ensure family migrants can 'stand on their own two feet financially'. It acted after receiving advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee and claiming it was a level at which 'we can be reasonably assured that the UK sponsor has sufficient means to support themselves and their foreign partner'. 'We welcome those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution. But family life must not be established here at the taxpayer's expense. 'That is why we implemented the recommendations of the Independent Migration Advisory Committee and established clear rules for British citizens looking to bring their non-EU spouse to this country, including a minimum income threshold.' The pair are now in discussions with an immigration lawyer and plan to appeal the latest decision, but they have also begun to consider other options.","Australian Jacky Collyer, 27, and husband set up a coffee shop in Swindon .

34,"An American teenager charged over the death of Australian baseballer Chris Lane has been handed a life sentence after he pleaded guilty to the random drive-by killing in 2013. Michael Jones, who was charged along with two other US teenagers, will not be eligible for parole until he is 56-years-old. Jones, who was the driver of the car from which a bullet was fired at Lane, begged for forgiveness as he was sentenced a minimum of 38 years in prison, the ABC reports. Lane, 22, from Melbourne, was shot in the back on August 16, 2013, in what police said was a random killing as he ran along a road in Duncan, southern Oklahoma, where he was on a sporting scholarship. American Michael Dewayne Jones has been sentenced to life in prison after he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for his involvement in the killing of Christopher Lane . The two other teens, charged with first-degree murder and accessory in the first, will face court next month. They were 17 and 16 at the time of the baseballer’s death. In December 2013, in the first courageous interview since her son’s death, Lane’s mother Donna Lane told the Daily Mail she doesn’t care what happens to the teens charged with killing her son. 'It's not going to bring my Chris back,' she said. Ms Lane told how she had shed tears every day for her only son, admitting that even though he had been living in the US for the past four years her life in Melbourne has been empty knowing he's never coming back for a visit. At her home in the suburb of Pascoe Vale, lying between Melbourne city centre and the airport, Donna opened a photograph album put together as a special memorial for her by his friends in the US. Lane (left and right), 22, from Melbourne, was shot in the back on August 16, 2013, in what police said was a random killing as he ran along a road in Duncan, southern Oklahoma, where he was on a sporting scholarship . Right there on the first page was a shot that makes her so proud - Chris in his baseball strip crouching, waiting for a catch. 'He was always good with the ball almost as soon as he could walk,' she said, turning the pages, smiling at one of him poking his tongue out at the camera. 'I'm not at all surprised he ended up as such a talented player. 'I know that his friends see him as a brilliant catcher and while he might be a super-hero to them he's still my son and what strikes me all the time is that even though he's so special I can't have him back. 'People ask me all the time what I think about the three who have been arrested in connection with his murder. But do you know what - I don't care. Donna Lane, mother of shot Australian baseball player Chris Lane, holds a framed Christmas card he and his girlfriend Sarah Harper had sent her on an earlier, happy festive season . Chris Lane with his girlfriend Sarah Harper during a visit to Australia, when Sarah took the opportunity to cuddle a koala . 'I don't care if they go to prison for life or if they walk free again. Whatever happens to them isn't going to bring Chris back. I'm not interested in what happens to them. 'What's the point of looking for some kind of retribution? How is it going to change things for me and my family? 'My friends tell me that if those three do walk free they might do it again, you know, hurt somebody else, but whatever happens over there now still doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever. 'What's done is done and I can't turn the clock back,' the devastated mother added. Chris was on a scholarship at the East Central University as a team catcher when he was killed.

35,"Their crimes were committed decades ago but these Edwardian crooks are as menacing as ever as they gaze out of their police mugshots taken way back at the turn of the 20th century. The motley crew,  including many women and children, were arrested on charges ranging from petty theft to murder and photographed before being hauled before the North Shields Police Court between 1902 and 1916. The fascinating images  were given to Tyne & Wear Archives back in November 2010 and over the last few weeks historians have been adding to the set which now holds over 1000 mugshots. Killer: Corsican Jerome Guerrini was jailed for 15 years in 1904 for murdering labourer Patrick Gilligan. The Judge  said of Corsicans: 'If there was anything that distinguished a Corsican from the native of any other country, it was the hotness of his blood and the constant use of the knife' Smutty: Both Thomas Wallace, left and James Dawson, right, were  arrested on charges of indecent exposure in June 1902 and February 1905 respectively . Susan Joice, left,  was arrested for larceny in August 1903 while Susannah Adamson, right, was arrested for the same crime  in 1904. Larceny was  a form of theft which involved 'taking and carrying away' property from someone else, but without committing or threatening violence . Alan Hayward, an archivist at Tyne and Wear Archives said: 'As the photos piled up we thought this would be a good opportunity to find out more about the stories behind them. 'The mugshots include quite a few of children. 'These can really tug at the heartstrings.' Among the crooks on display are youngsters David Lloyd, 15, and George Burn, 14, who were arrested on 10 November 1902 for larceny, a form of theft. Historians from the archive have been trying to find out more about the pictures and found a report in the Shields Daily News which said that the boys were charged with 'stealing on the 8th inst. from a wash-house in Prudhoe Street brushes and a box worth 3s, the property of Peter Johnson'. The Shields Daily News for 17 November 1902 then revealed that the boys pleaded guilty to the offences and their parents were bound over in the sum of £5 for their good behaviour during the following 6 months. Young offenders: David Lloyd, 15, left, and his accomplice George Burn, 14, right, were both convicted in November 1902 for stealing 'brushes and a box worth 3s' from a wash house, alongside his accomplice George Burn, 14. The Shields Daily News reported that the boys pleaded guilty to the offences and their parents were bound over in the sum of £5 for their good behaviour during the following 6 months . Charlotte Branney and William Wilson were both arrested for larceny in  January 1904 and February 1905 respectively. The offence was abolished in 1968, and replaced with the broader crime of theft . Rogues: John Currey, left, was arrested in July 1905 while Simon Sheffield, right, was arrested in June 1906 the offences are unknown . But by the far the most terrifying Edwardian criminal featured is Corsican Jerome Guerrini, who was jailed for 15 years in 1904 for killing labourer Patrick Gilligan. Mr Hayward added: 'While the images of child prisoners really caught my attention, there was another case featured in the album, which had the same effect for completely different reasons. 'Rather than generating sympathy for the prisoner, this mugshot sent a shiver down my spine. 'There was something menacing about the prisoner's appearance and the word 'Murder' on the board he was holding didn't help matters either. 'The case would have been featured in countless newspapers around the country but I was able to find a particularly good account by searching the British Newspapers collection on the findmypast website. 'The account appeared in the Morpeth Herald for 26 November 1904 and it revealed that the prisoner Jerome Guerrini (who also went under the alias of Joseph Brunetti) was a 27-year old Corsican who had spent the previous four years at sea as a fireman.' The Morpeth Herald reported that the man was accused of murdering labourer Patrick Gilligan who lived on Clive Street, North Shields (with two brothers named Davis), almost directly opposite the lodgings occupied by the accused. Annie Anderson was arrested for larceny in August 1903, left, while Mary A Butts,right, was arrested for the same crime in December 1904 . Ellen Healey, left and Maud M Garmey, right, were both arrested for unknown offences  in 1905 and 1908 respectively. Little more is known about the two women . Alfred Thompson, left, was arrested for larceny in August 1902 while Mary Brewis, right, was arrested for an unknown offence in February 1908 . Mr Hayward added: 'The Judge's summing up is interesting in the rather casual way that it stereotypes Corsicans. 'Did Gillighan single out Guerrini because he was a foreigner?' The report states that Judge Darling, in his summing up, said that 'if there was anything that distinguished a Corsican from the native of any other country, it was the hotness of his blood and the constant use of the knife.' The jury found Guerrini guilty of manslaughter and he was sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude. Mr Hayward said: 'By bringing together information from different sources, in this case a photograph album and local newspapers, it's possible to bring some fascinating, if tragic, stories to life. 'To my mind the mugshot album is particularly interesting because it relates to a port town. 'It gives us an insight into the lives of both locals and transient visitors such as Jerome Guerrini.' At the turn of the century North Shields, which is eight miles east of Newcastle, was an important fishing town and shipyard. It was also crucial to the industry of the North-East, leading to widespread urban poverty which might explain some of the crime documented in these photographs.","Police mugshots dating from the turn of the 20th century have been handed to the Tyne & Wear Archives .

36,"Scotland's Richie Ramsay recovered from seeing a three-shot lead disappear in the space of two holes to win the Hassan Trophy after a rollercoaster final round on Sunday. Ramsay made a blistering start at Golf du Palais Royal, carding four birdies in a row from the third to move into pole position in pursuit of his third European Tour title. The 31-year-old from Aberdeen then three-putted the seventh and ran up a triple-bogey six on the eighth, where he came up short of the green off the tee and saw his first two chips fail to negotiate a steep slope and roll back to his feet. Richie Ramsey poses with the Hassan Trophy after winning the event at Golf du Palais Royal in Morocco . Ramsay reacts after his second shot on the tenth hole during the final round of the Hassan Trophy . That left Ramsay two shots off the lead but he battled back superbly with a hat-trick of birdies from the 12th to reclaim the lead on his way to a closing 69 to finish 10 under par, one ahead of France's Romain Wattel. Wattel chipped in for par on the 15th after duffing his fourth shot just a few feet and birdied the 17th to get within one of Ramsay, but was unable to chip in for another birdie on the 18th to force a play-off. Six players shared third place on eight under, including South African George Coetzee, who had needed to win to move into the world's top 50 and qualify for the Masters. England's Tommy Fleetwood could also have secured a trip to Augusta with victory, but finished joint 17th after a closing 69. An emotional Ramsay, who had missed the cut in four of his five events this season and withdrew from the other after three rounds due to illness, dedicated the win to his wife Angela and brother Robin. Ramsay  hits his tee-shot on the first hole during the final round before winning the competition . Ramsay (left) is presented with his winner's trophy by  HRH Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco (right) 'It means a huge amount,' Ramsay told Sky Sports 4. 'My brother has supported me since I was so young. This one's for him and Angela. I know they are all back home and probably going crazy at the moment. 'I've gone through some tough times with injury but kept believing and they were at my back and said just go out there and play golf and that's what I did today. It was so much fun out there.' Asked about his triple bogey on the eighth, the former US amateur champion added: 'I just didn't execute the shot exactly as I wanted to. Hit a poor chip, rolled back into a divot, didn't come out, hit it back on, two putts, easy six. It's one of those courses that has so many holes like that. 'I knew I was still in the mix and walking down nine I was still level par for my round and I knew the back nine was very scoreable. I made great putts on nine and 10 just to keep the momentum going and then I stood over a putt on the 12th and felt my putter feels absolutely great. 'I said to myself just got for it, this is your time and pretty much took it by the scruff of the neck the next two holes.'","Richie Ramsay was delighted to win trophy after tough campaign .

'The influence of Rio and Richard Dunne, two good centre halves, made me think I could learn from them.'

Arlie Smith, 45, has worked at the big box store in Danville for more than 21 years, and is known for drawing smiles and flowers on receipts for customers' children. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a disease his mother also had, two years ago and in September doctors said that he had kidney cancer that spread to his bones. He is estimated to have less than three years left to live. Scroll down for video . Roughly two dozen customers surprised Danville Costco greeter Arlie Smith (right) 45, with a beach vacation after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer last year . Customers of the store, calling themselves Arlie's Angels, raised $2,500 so their favorite employee could go on a four-night vacation with his wife Shari to a resort in Laguna Beach, California. Organized by customer Bridgette Loughnane, a group of about two dozen surprised Mr Smith at work on Tuesday, and came along with his wife and local news stations. The package, which the Angels had been planning since October, also had sunscreen, a picture frame, seashells and a heartfelt note from customers.

42,"It’s nearly time for Kell Brook to make an emotional walk to the ring and fight Jo Jo Dan on March 28. He has the world at his feet again and I’m looking at fights against the likes of Juan Manuel Marquez, Brandon Rios and Keith Thurman in the summer and then the winner of Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather. But it was so nearly game over for Kell. I remember being sat next to his bed in the hospital in Tenerife and I didn’t know if he would fight again. I think it’s hard for you or I to imagine to what he has been through since that horrific knife attack. But this guy is special. Dan is going to face a fighter in Sheffield who has only thought about fighting for the past six months. It has been hard on Kell – he won a world title and what was supposed to be his moment has been spent recovering from that attack. It’s been a nightmare. Kell Brook with his world title in September as he began his recovery from being stabbed in the leg . The challenge – and it is a big challenge – will be handling himself in the right manner on the night. Everyone wants to see how he comes back physically from what happened. But how will he cope with the emotions? He will be in his own city, defending his title after all that frustration and pain. There is a lot that can go wrong in those circumstances. But Kell is different to normal people. The night he won his world title against Shawn Porter in California, the stakes were so high. He was fighting in Porter’s backyard after having so many title shots postponed because of injury. A normal person could easily have been swallowed up by that pressure – the rest of us were properly nervous. I was there in his dressing room looking at him for a sign of how he was feeling. My dad walked over to Kell just before he put his gloves, grabbed his arm and said to him: ‘This is your time, don’t let this moment pass.' I went outside the dressing room and my dad was smiling. He said to me: ‘That boy is barely breathing. He is about to fight for the world title in America and his pulse is so low.’ The Sheffield fighter lands a punch on Shawn Porter on his way to becoming world champion in August 2014 . I am telling you, this guy has ice in his veins. Nothing fazes him. He has been stabbed in the leg and could have died. Now, a few months on he is fighting to retain his world title. People will doubt him but I won’t. That is why I will make the biggest fights possible for him if he comes through this next challenge against Dan. I have already made contact with Marquez’s people and also Rios’s representatives. Marquez is a legend and that would be a huge fight and Rios has been a world champion. Thurman is also keen and a quality fighter. Any one of those guys in Sheffield in June would be a very big fight. After that, I would love to see Kell fight Pacquiao or Mayweather. Anyone would. After those two fight on May 2, the winner and Kell will be the only world champions in the welterweight division. It would be a great unification match. Of course, the fight the whole country wants to see is Kell versus Amir Khan. Khan’s team told us the fight would happen one day but why not on June 13 at Wembley? We can’t wait forever for them. All Kell can do is take care of his own business later this month. It’s a challenge but he always comes through. Brook is putting together his final training preparations before fighting Jo Jo Dan later this month . Another fight everyone is desperate to see is Carl Frampton versus Scott Quigg. Talks are underway between me and Barry McGuigan’s Cyclone Promotions, who look after Frampton. Scott is not worried about where the fight is staged or what television channel it is shown on – we just want to make this fight. Of course the finances have to be right and we have submitted a proposal that will pay both fighters huge money. They will talk with their broadcaster and see what’s on offer and then hopefully we will sit down as soon as possible. After that, we can push negotiations on. I’m not sure if we will ever find an agreed split - I would be happy for a 60-40 purse split in favour of the winner. If you really fancy it I can’t see a problem with that. Let’s see. We can talk about world titles and legacy and exposure but ultimately this is a super fight – and in a super fight it is only right that these two great fighters get the best deal possible financially. If we can all reach an agreement, then I would love to make this fight in June. We’d be happy to fight in Belfast if the numbers were right, but likewise Manchester would be brilliant and so would the O2 Arena in London. There is a long way to go but who wouldn’t want to see this fight? Scott Quigg (right) joins Carl Frampton in the ring after he beat Chris Avalos in Belfast last month . I was disappointed to lose the purse bids for James DeGale-Andre Dirrell after some long negotiations with Dirrell’s team. We backed our man to a tune of $2.1m but they put in a huge bid of $3.1m. I’m confident James DeGale gets the victory regardless of the location and make history in the process. I am hearing rumours that the fight will be on April 24 in Chicago but we back James to get the win. Tony Bellew is back in the UK after his foray into Hollywood. Don’t ask me how he came to be involved in the Creed film, but what a great opportunity for him. We will be talking in the coming days about his options, but rest assured after beating Nathan Cleverly last time out, he will be in a world title fight next time. We are looking at all four of the cruiserweight world champions. Marco Huck, the WBO champion, is keen and appeals to us as well. But we would fight any of Denis Lebedev (WBA champion), Grigory Drozd (WBC) or Yoan Pablo Hernandez (IBF). All are quality fighters and I have had good feedback on all options so watch this space. We are heading for a brilliant battle of Hull lightweights this summer. Golden boy Luke Campbell was brilliant again in beating Levis Morales in Hull at the weekend and Tommy Coyle survived a huge scare against Martin Gethin on the same card. He was knocked down but got up and perforated Gethin’s ear drum to win. They are both huge draws in the city and now I am going to make the fight between them for this summer. They are a great mix. Coyle’s family is known all over Hull – they have a fruit and veg stall in the middle of the city and Tommy is full of beans. Luke is already an MBE, the boy with an Olympic gold medal. Tommy Coyle celebrates his win over Martin Gethin at The Hull Arena on March 7 . Above all else, they are tremendous fighters. It will really divide the city. I am looking at the KC Stadium and Craven Park, probably for a date in mid-July. Many people would have Campbell as favourite but how can anyone underestimate Tommy Coyle? This will be a huge night. I would like to say here how relieved I was to hear that Charlie Payton is OK after being taken to hospital following his defeat against Bobby Jenkinson in Hull at the weekend. He looked in a bad way but has been given the all-clear, thankfully. It reminds you how tough this sport is and, for me, it reinforces that above all else these guys ought to get the paydays they deserve. People say that fighters should ignore the money and just get fights made – it is easy to say when you are not the one putting your health on the line for your living. Fight for titles and fight for glory, of course, but let’s remember what these athletes put themselves through in the process.","It's time to judge what Kell Brook is made of when he makes his comeback from being stabbed .

44,"A wave of migrants 4,500 years ago left their trace in the DNA and languages of modern Europeans. This is according to a study that found evidence of this Stone Age migration by analysing DNA of 69 people who lived across Europe between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago. Among the shifts in the genetic make-up of ancient Europeans they found that DNA associated with the Yamnaya people appeared strongly in what is now northern Germany. Researchers have identified a mass migration of Kurgan populations (Yamna culture) which went from the Russian steppes to the centre of Europe 4,500 years ago. Previously, researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe . There are two main theories as to how Indo-European languages spread in Europe. The first is the Anatolian hypothesis, which claims spread of the language occurred some 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East (currently Turkey) brought it to Europe. The Kurgan hypothesis, meanwhile, proposes that the language was spread by nomadic herders of the steppes found to the north of the Black and Caspian Sea. This theory suggests their language spread throughout Europe after the invention of wheeled vehicles, from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago. The Yamnaya were herders who lived in the steppe north of the Black and Aral Seas. This injection of DNA indicates 'a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery,' said the researchers, led by David Reich of Harvard Medical School. Such a large-scale influx would likely have affected not just the DNA but ancient cultures as well. Although genes can't determine what people spoke, the researchers argue that their findings could influence the debate about the origins of Indo-European tongues. Indo-European languages include more than 400 tongues, from modern languages such as English and Polish to ancient languages like Hittite and Sanskrit. Basque, which is spoken in south-west France and northern Spain, is not Indo-European, and may be the only surviving relic of earlier languages once spoken more widely, according to the BBC. Linguists have long debated whether Indo-European languages came to Europe with farmers migrating from the Middle East or some other group, such as the Yamnaya. Previously, researchers had believed that Indo-European language spread some 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe. The latest study suggests that Europe was first reshaped at this time in what archaeologists call the Neolithic Revolution. Farmers from Anatolia travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe. This was followed by a second wave of people several thousand years later from what is today Ukraine and Russia. The latest study suggests that Europe was first reshaped during the Neolithic Revolution 8,500 years ago. Farmers at this time travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe. Pictured is an early Neolithic 35-40 year old male from, Czech Republic, who was part of the first mass migration to Europe . As well as genetic evidence, researchers point to the fact that many Indo-European languages share words for things like axles, harness poles, and the wheel. These devices were invented long after the Neolithic Revolution began in Europe. 'Major language replacements are thought to require large-scale migration,' said the authors of the study, which was published Monday by the journal Nature. 'Our results make a compelling case for the steppe as a source of at least some of the Indo-European languages in Europe.' Andrew Garrett, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the study, said it was significant that the mass migration occurred at a time some models had previously identified for Indo-European expansion. 'It fills in a significant piece of a big and interesting puzzle,' said Garrett.","Study looked at DNA of Europeans who lived  8,000 and 3,000 years ago .

It has requested that Somalia receives $118million of this.

The U.S. source said Mohamed was arrested several days ago by Somali authorities and was now in Somali custody, but it was not clear if or when he would be sent back to the United States. The Washington Post first reported on Monday that Mohamed had been detained in Somalia. Mohamed lived in the northern Virginia suburbs near Washington and drove a taxi.

46,"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has again criticised referee Mike Dean for his handling of Saturday's London derby defeat by Crystal Palace. The Hammers, currently in ninth place in the Premier League, were beaten 3-1 by the Eagles at the weekend in a contentious contest. Allardyce felt that Palace striker Glenn Murray, scorer of two goals at Upton Park, before being sent off in the 69th minute, should have been dismissed by Dean in the first half for persistent fouling. Glenn Murray was sent off for Crystal Palace during the 3-1 win against West Ham on Saturday . Sam Allardyce was frustrated that Murray was not sent off earlier in the game . Allardyce said: 'The biggest problem for me was that Glenn Murray shouldn't have been on the field, not only because of persistent fouling but the level of his fouling. 'Mike Dean, whom I have a lot of respect for, is a very good referee, but he was too lenient with Murray by telling him 'that's your last chance' after the first booking. 'In that particular instance, Palace have been let off. Mike Dean has a massive responsibility on the fact that (Murray) was one of the main reasons why Crystal Palace won. 'And for me that is something disappointing. The fact a referee warns a player for a tackle he has just made, which normally gets a yellow card, and yet he is only warned because he has just had a yellow card. And that is frustrating.' Murray climbed highest to open the scoring for the visitors in the first half with a header . Murray got his second and Palace's third when he glanced a header past Adrian . Palace captain Mile Jedinak was caught on Sky Sports TV cameras apparently elbowing Diafra Sakho as they both challenged for the ball in the closing stages. Though the incident was not seen at the time by the match officials, the Football Association have since charged the player with violent conduct – and Palace have until Tuesday evening to appeal against that decision. Allardyce has welcomed any retrospective punishment, saying that the Australian midfielder deserves a ban for acting in a dangerous manner against the Senegal striker. He added: 'Jedinak was clearly in a position where Mike Dean couldn't see it. I think about how dangerous it was. It was a very dangerous thing he did. He could have seriously injured Sakho. And he will have to take the punishment – because I think he deserves it.' Mile Jedinak has been charged by the FA with violent conduct after catching Diafra Sakho with his elbow . The incident went unpunished during the game but Jedinak was retrospectively charged . Elsewhere, in his pre-match press conference, ahead of the visit of Chelsea to East London tomorrow night, Allardyce spoke about the chats he enjoyed with Dave Mackay, the former Tottenham, Derby, Hearts and Scotland enforcer, who died aged 80. Allardyce said: 'I knew Dave. He lived in around Nottingham, when I was at Notts County for three years (1997-1999). I spent many a good night with him talking away about his time in football, about management. 'It's a sad day. He was a terrific guy not just a terrific a footballer. In life, you take a lot of things from a lot of people. 'If you want to get better, you don't just read a book or do a Masters' degree at university; you learn a lot from listening to the experiences of people who have been great in their own careers.'","West Ham were beaten 3-1 by Crystal Palace at Upton Park on Saturday .

48,"Voters in every ethnic group want the number of migrants coming to Britain to be cut, reveals a report out today. Overall, the survey found that 79 per cent of respondents thought immigration levels should be reduced with 59 per cent wanting a big drop. This support for stricter border controls was shared by people from all ethnic groups, according to analysis by campaign group Migration Watch. Home Secretary Theresa May has been pushing for a firm immigration pledge to be included in the next Tory manifesto, after the failed a pledge to cut the number coming here to 'tens of thousands' Some 60 per cent of Asian respondents wish to see immigration reduced, with 38 per cent wanting it down by a lot. The same is true of black respondents with 57 per cent thinking it should be curbed and 32 per cent wanting a large cut. For those of mixed origin, 60 per cent wanted a decrease with 30 per cent wanting a big fall. Of those classed as ‘other’ ethnicities, 56 per cent wanted a drop with 32 per cent believing there should be a large reduction. For all minority groups combined, most want lower immigration levels while about 30 per cent want them to stay the same. Only one in ten want it to rise, making it unlikely that policies to curb immigration would deter ethnic minorities from voting for the Conservatives. The report is a response to the centre-right lobby group Bright Blue, which claims the Tories must abandon their target to limit net migration to attract more black and ethnic minority voters. Home Secretary Theresa May, who wants a firm pledge to cut migration in the Tory manifesto, recently quit as a member of Bright Blue’s advisory board. A poll by Migration Watch found that 60 per cent of Asians, 57 per cent of black people, and 60 per cent of those from mixed backgrounds wanted to see a cut (pictured, pedestrians on a street in London) Migration Watch said that while tighter immigration controls do not deter voters from an ethnic minority background, the tone of the debate must be ‘right’. It said black and ethnic minority voters are more likely to see previous waves of immigration as positive for the UK but are clearly concerned about current levels. Vice-chairman Alp Mehmet said: ‘The report confirms that the concerns of ethnic minority voters are very similar to everyone else and why wouldn’t they be? ‘The way to appeal to ethnic minority communities is to propose reasonable policies and reducing net migration to the level last seen in the early 1990s is entirely reasonable.’ Kiran Bali, a member of Migration Watch who has founded a series of inter-faith groups, said: ‘The majority of people share similar concerns. ‘They are worried about schools, hospitals, jobs and overcrowding. ‘It is ludicrous to lump diverse communities together in suggesting we all want mass immigration. Reasonable levels are the only way to achieve strengthened community relations.’ The Tories are expected to repeat David Cameron’s promise to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. It is now almost 300,000. The report is based on the British Social Attitudes Survey, a long-running poll of 3,000 residents. Blair aide: We didn't expect all those Polish plumbers . Sir Stephen Wall, EU adviser from 2000 to 2004, said Labour didn't see the attraction Britain would present to skilled Polish workers, such as plumbers . Labour failed to realise the UK would prove a magnet for Polish plumbers, Tony Blair’s most senior EU adviser admitted yesterday. The admission came in a series of revelations about how Labour chronically mishandled Eastern European immigration. In advance of Poland and seven other Eastern Bloc nations joining the EU in 2004, ministers relied upon advice suggesting only 13,000 would settle each year. But more than one million have travelled to the UK, attracted by wages which are significantly higher than at home – with at least half settling here in what proved one of the biggest waves of immigration in British history. Sir Stephen Wall, an EU adviser between 2000 and 2004, said: ‘We simply didn’t take account properly of the pull factor of England for people with skills who could probably find a bigger market [in the UK] for their skills – you know, the Polish plumber.’ The remarks risk re-igniting the debate about Labour’s record on immigration – for which Ed Miliband recently apologised. Last night Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, told the Mail: ‘It is astonishing that nobody properly considered the impact of the wage differential between Britain and ... Poland. 'We said at the time the forecast of 13,000 a year was almost worthless. In fact, it was completely worthless.’ Yesterday it also emerged that former Labour Cabinet minister John Denham had written to Chancellor Gordon Brown and Home Secretary Charles Clarke in 2006 to warn the new arrivals were having a huge impact but was largely ignored. Mr Denham said that wages were being driven down by as much as 50 per cent and that A&E departments were under strain, adding: ‘On EU migration there was a catastrophic failure of the civil service machine.’ Not backing down: Despite Mr Wall's comments, former Home Secretary David Blukett (pictured during his time in office) defended Labour's record, he is 'confident' mass migration was a good idea . In a further bombshell, respected economist Paul Ormerod, writing in the Left-wing Guardian newspaper, exploded Labour’s economic case for mass migration.

Von Thurn und Taxis, who has been with the magazine since 2012, received a slew of criticism from followers claiming the photo was 'cruel' and 'tasteless'. Scroll down for video . Vogue's style editor-at-large Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis posted this photo on Instagram, with the caption, 'Paris is full of surprises....and @vouguemagazine readers even in unexpected corners!' Many commenters criticized von Thurn und Taxis for posting the picture. Some claimed the photo was 'cruel' and 'tasteless' The editor, who was in Paris for fashion week, responded to the commenters, asking 'Why cruel? The person to me is as dignified as anyone else!' Style website Fashionista claimed the photo, like von Thurn und Taxis's other content, was 'out of touch'. 'The things she writes, both in Vogue and on social media, often straddle the line between entertaining/aspirational and disturbingly out of touch. On Saturday she crossed that line,' the website wrote. Some commenters supported the 32-year-old editor, but the post disappeared from her feed about five hours after it was posted, according to CNN. The German princess is the daughter of Countess Gloria von Schönburg-Glauchau, known as 'Princess TNT, the dynamite socialite' and Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Her brother Albert, 31, who succeeded their father in 1990 as Albert II, Prince of Thurn and Taxis, has a net worth of more than £1billion and races in a German auto-racing league. The princess was educated at Sevenoaks in Kent and has a bachelor's degree from the American University of Paris. Von Thurn und Taxis was in Paris for Fashion week when she posted the photo. On the left she can be seen at the Christian Dior show with Noor Fares and Olympia Scarry. On the right she is pictured at the Christian Dior - Party At les Bains Douches on Thursday. Her blog 'The Princess Diaries', which appeared in Finch's Quarterly Review, contrasted the difficulties faced by royalty with more 'normal issues'. The family's wealth originated from their postal system empire which can be traced back to around 1290 when two early ancestors operated courier services in the Italian city-states. But the  family's important postal activities began with Franz von Taxis, who served as postmaster to the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian I from 1489 and to Philip I of Spain from 1504. The Prussian empire originally bought out the Thurn and Taxis monopoly in 1867 and used it as the basis for a new German national post. A member of the family is believed to have invented the taximeter, which is why taxicabs came to bear his name. The House of Thurn and Taxis held the rank of royalty in the German Empire until 1918.","Style editor Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis posted the photo on Saturday .

In addition to Tesla, most of the world's automakers sell or are developing electric cars. The Virgin firm could take on Elon Musk's Tesla electric car firm, according to Branson. There are also signs Apple may be working on an electric car and Google is developing a car that can drive itself. However, broader acceptance of electric cars has been held back by the premium consumers must pay for the technology and fears about the driving range of an all-electric vehicle.

52,"The mother of an Alabama girl testified through tears on Monday that the child's grandmother doesn't deserve to live after being convicted of running her nine-year-old granddaughter to death. Heather Walker took the stand in support of prosecutors who want the death penalty for her former mother-in-law, Joyce Hardin Garrard. Walker said the 49-year-old Garrard 'shouldn't be spared' after being convicted of capital murder in the death of Savannah Hardin. Scroll down for video . Savannah Hardin (left) died in 2012 after her grandmother punished her by making her run around the house for three hours. Her mother, Heather Walker (right), told the court that she believes her ex-mother-in-law deserves the death penalty . Joyce Hardin Garrard was found guilty of capital murder on Friday. After  more than three hours of deliberation an Etowah County jury found Garrard guilty of murder in the death of nine-year-old granddaughter, Savannah Hardin . 'I personally feel like I see no remorse and she took away my baby's life,' Walker said of Garrard. Seated just a few feet away at the defense table, Garrard showed no emotion. Meanwhile, much of Walker's testimony was hard to understand because she was sobbing uncontrollably. Walker, who is divorced from Garrard's son Robert and has since remarried, said she wasn't allowed to see Savannah during the last two years of the girl's life. She had sent multiple care packages that were returned to her, and when she would phone the numbers, eventually all the contact numbers she had had been changed. But then one day a number she didn't recognize phoned her, she told the court on Monday, and it was Robert calling to say Savannah had suffered brain swelling following a seizure . 'How soon can you get here?', he asked. At that point in her testimony Ms Walker burst into tears, detailing how she tried frantically to get more information. When she finally tracked her daughter down at Children's Hospital a person on the line said she needed 'the grandmother's permission' to give Heather any information. Joyce tried to keep Heather from being alone with Savannah when she did get there. Monday on the stand Heather sobbed as described her daughter, who looked normal other than some blood on her face, but was nonetheless hooked up to machines with a fatal injury. Savannah never had ADHD to her memory and had no injuries or other medical issues. ''I couldn't understand how that could just happen,' she said she thought. Heather had not seen daughter Savannah in the year before her death, as she moved out of state to live with her father and stepmother. Jessica says she repeatedly sent things, which would be returned to sender to her . Jurors convicted Garrard on Friday and now must decide whether to recommend death or life without parole, the only options under Alabama law. The final decision is up to the judge. Garrard showed no reaction when the guilty verdict was read, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies. She glared toward the audience as she walked out silently. Some of her relatives sitting behind her began to cry. Defense attorney Dani Bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict, delivered after about three-and-a-half hours of deliberation. Garrard's husband, Johnny, sat behind her, hugging a crying daughter before the daughter ran from the courtroom sobbing. The defense will begin presenting its case for a life sentence on Wednesday. Savannah collapsed and had a seizure after carrying wood as Garrard refused to let her stop running. She died three days later in hospital . Prosecutors said Garrard — with eight surviving grandchildren and a ninth-grade education — should be put to death for making the child run around her yard and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy in February 2012. Prosecutors contended that Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise. In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson. Defense attorney Richard Rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9-year-old Savannah while the girl's father was overseas working as a contractor for the U.S. State Department. Under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Rhea, Walker said she didn't believe Garrard 'woke up that morning' planning to kill Savannah. Rather, she said, the situation seemed to get out of hand. 'I think there was a point where she knew what she was doing,' Walker said. Another witness, Samuel Hudgins, testified he saw the girl running laps around the house that day as Garrard stood by. Garrard forced Savannah to run around the house and carry wood as punishment for a lie about candy in February 2012 . Some witnesses who testified about seeing Garrard force Savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than Garrard appeared to be, Griffith said. But Rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day. Garrard showed no reaction when she was found guilty, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies . He said, 'I think we have all had the thought: 'If it was that bad, why didn't they do something?'' He said witnesses didn't notify police about their concerns until days later, after they heard girl was on life support. 'Then it becomes 'Oh yeah, I witnessed boot camp. I witnessed the drill sergeant from hell',' he said. Garrard was the final witness to testify on Wednesday and attorneys for both sides concluded their closing arguments Friday afternoon. Savannah collapsed from a seizure and died three days later in a hospital in Birmingham after doctors determined there was no brain activity and removed her from life support. An autopsy blamed her death on seizures cause by low sodium following extreme physical exertion. Walker described the mournful scene in the hospital room as a physician turned off a breathing machine as a test to see whether Savannah, who was unconscious, would breathe on her own. 'During this time Joyce was just screaming at Savannah saying, 'Savannah, you need to breathe,'' Walker said. Within moments it was obvious Savannah wouldn't survive, she said. 'I held her hand until her body stiffened up,' said Walker, sobbing and barely understandable. But Garrard seemed more worried about herself than her granddaughter, Walker said. Later at the hospital, Walker said, Garrard grabbed the shoulders of the child's pregnant stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin. Even though Hardin was in labor at the time and would later give birth, Garrard seemed intent on getting the other woman's attention, Walker said. 'She said, 'Jessica, there's a lot on the line. You need to pull it together,'' Walker said. Walker said already had suspicions about what had happened to her daughter, and she became 'more uneasy' after hearing Garrard's remarks to Hardin. Garrard (left) and Jessica Mae Hardin (right), Savannah's stepmother, were arrested in February 2012. Garrard has been waiting in jail for three years for her sentence. Harden has also been charged with her murder, for allegedly sitting by as Garrard ran the girl to death, which carries a life sentence . Garrard and Hardin were both at the house the afternoon the girl ran, evidence showed. Garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years, and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence. Hardin has also been charged with her murder, for allegedly sitting by as Garrard ran the girl to death, which carries a life sentence. The girl was in the care of her stepmother and grandmother while her father was away. Hardin, who is awaiting trial, gave birth the day after her arrest in 2012. Savannah loved cheer leading and horses and wanted to be a veterinarian when she grew up, Walker said. 'She was full of life. She was the sweetest little girl,' said Walker.","Joyce Hardin Garrad, 49, was convicted for the 2012 murder of her granddaughter Savannah Hardin, aged nine .

53,"A top university official ran up a £45,000 expenses bill in just 14 months, it has emerged. Sheila O'Neal, executive director of development at Bangor University, spent the money on flights, hotels and meals - including a £10,000 trip to New York for herself and three colleagues. During the trip last March, the group watched Emma Thompson and Bryn Terfel on Broadway in the  Stephen Sondheim production production of Sweeney Todd. Expenses: Sheila O'Neal, executive director of development at Bangor University, pictured, spent the money on flights, hotels and meals - including a £10,000 trip to New York for herself and three colleagues . Ms O'Neal, who took up her post in the autumn of 2013, also spent more than £1,000 on taxis, £5,400 on food and £14,000 on hotels between October 2013 and December 2014. The figures were obtained by S4C’s current affairs programme Y Byd ar Bedwar. The university defended the New York visit, saying it was necessary in order to raise funds for future developments. Ms O'Neal, 60, was joined on the trip by vice-chancellor Professor John Hughes and his wife, Dr Xinyu Wu, the university's director of international development. Elen ap Robert, artistic director of Pontio, the university's new arts centre, was also invited. The centre will include a 450-seat theatre named after Terfel, who has an honourary doctorate from the institution. Colleagues: Ms O'Neal, 60, was joined on the trip by vice-chancellor Professor John Hughes, left, and his wife, Dr Xinyu Wu, right, the university's director of international development on the £10,000 trip to New York . Work on Pontio is currently running months behind schedule with the £49 million project already £12 million over budget. Terfel has previously defended the delay saying they needed 'time to get everything perfect'. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman Simon Thomas said: 'I understand that this trip was involved with Pontio. 'I would think that their resources would be better spent making sure the building work is finished on time instead of flying out to New York.' The president of Bangor's students' union, Rhys Taylor, said: 'I don't think there was any need to send staff over to New York for this trip. 'I think it's important that these decisions are discussed more openly with the rest of the university, including students and members of staff.' A university spokesman said the trip was necessary to raise more funds for the university and added it had generated £2.2 million since Mrs O'Neal took her post. Ms O'Neal has received a 'reminder' over her expenses bill ran-up between October 2013 and December 2014. A spokesman told S4C's Y Byd ar Bedwar ('The World on Four') program: 'The university has succeeded in raising £2.2m since Ms O'Neal took up her post in autumn 2013. 'Expenses connected to this job are higher than other roles within the university however, this is because it is pursuing an ambitious fundraising programme.

54,"For Rangers captain Lee McCulloch, the SPFL Championship table has become a torment. A headache the arrival of a new board of directors simply can’t cure. Lying 22 points behind relentless leaders Hearts, there is now no hiding place for the Ibrox players. The off-field problems have eased, Stuart McCall is in place as manager and, simply put, there are no excuses left. ‘It is time for everybody to stand up and be men,’ said McCulloch. ‘Take the ball, demand the ball in front of a crowd, don’t hide and go and show that you’ re good enough to be here.’ Rangers captain Lee McCulloch has urged his team-mates to stand up and be counted . Under Kenny McDowall, Rangers played as if a grey, leaden cloud hung over Ibrox. In comparison, a home game with doomed Livingston offers McCall the chance to be a breath of fresh air around the place. Rangers need something to rescue a flailing season and advance from the play-offs to the Premiership by hook or by crook. ‘It’s been a frustrating season for everyone, fans, players, off-the-field,’ added McCulloch. ‘I think it would be a wasted season if we don’t go up. It would be a season that would go down as a massive failure. ‘For everyone, it has been frustrating, but it’s still in our own hands as players. Everything else seems to have been sorted out, so it’s basically up to us now to try and get a play-off place and see what happens.’ Currently third in the league, the gap on second place Hibernian is a manageable five points. Rangers have two games in hand and winning them would ease concerns they might slip out of the play-offs altogether — a state of affairs which would be completely unacceptable to their captain. ‘It’s not as if I’ve been going home and made a cup of tea and thinking everything’s all right,’ McCulloch insisted. ‘It’s killing me inside, to be honest with you. To see Hearts so far clear in the league and we’re nowhere near them. It’s not nice and it’s not what we want or are used to.’ The weeks ahead will reveal much about this Rangers team. Off-field turmoil drew attention from their failings. The managerial situation, where McDowall was a reluctant frontman, provided a further shield. McCulloch says Rangers must finish in the play-off positions this season . McCulloch and McCall referred to a crisis of confidence repeatedly yesterday. For many of these players, the suspicion is that Rangers may simply be too big for them. ‘The players have probably felt it even more since Ally (McCoist) left,’ added the captain. ‘It is amazing what he took on his shoulders. He shielded the players away from it. Since he left, the players as a squad have been getting it from all angles. ‘I think confidence has probably dipped because of that. ‘Everybody knows we haven’t been playing as well as we can or as well as we should have been. I think there are loads of small things that you can make excuses for. But even though there has been a lot of off-field stuff going on, you can’t really make an excuse for how we have been playing. ‘This season, whoever has been on the board, we’ve not lived up to the standard that we should have for many different reasons. But it is nothing to do with who was in charge or on the board. ‘Since the new owners have come in, everyone around the place, the players and the staff, has had a wee bit of a spring in their step. It is probably a good thing.’ For a dozen of the players, out of contract in the summer, these are crucial days. McCulloch is one of them and, while some of the players won’t be sorry to leave, the 36-year-old wants to complete the journey back to the top division as a Rangers player. ‘The new manager has come in and said: “Well, it’s up to yourselves to go out there and earn it. If you want to be here next season then go and earn your contract and show that you are worthy of one”. I think that is the best thing for it. ‘It is a big motivation for me. I’m not getting any younger. Stuart McCall begins his reign at Rangers with home game against Livingston . ‘It would be amazing, it would be brilliant to go back to the top and it would be nice. But at times football isn’t nice. ‘So I would love to be here, but I need to go and earn that myself. I know that as does every other player here.’ Some have a head start. Nicky Law was a stand-out under McCall at Motherwell and for the new manager bringing the best out of him and others is the key to earning the job on a permanent basis. ‘I want everyone to go out and express themselves,’ said McCall after his second training session. ‘Not just Nicky but I know there’s more in his locker. I know he can do more and like a lot of the players when you lack a bit of that confidence you can go into your shell. ‘We want the players to go and express themselves, there are some good footballers in there. ‘A lot of players have shown good stuff in training.’ In a supreme irony, the most impressive of all has been one of Mike Ashley’s January imports on loan from Newcastle. ‘Haris Vuckic has been absolutely outstanding in training, bright and bubbly and a fantastic lad,’ reported McCall. ‘He hadn’t had much football but is certainly a talented individual and has been really bright in training. ‘He has been terrific but I was coming in thinking there might be three or four of these lads up and running.’ In reality, Remie Streete is ill and injured, Kevin Mbabu played an under-20 game on Thursday but is well short, Shane Ferguson has yet to cross the border and Gael Bigirimana has a medical condition. ‘One out of five isn’t bad,’ grinned McCall after waking at 5am in anticipation of his return to Ibrox as a Rangers employee. ‘It’s been a whirlwind. I haven’t even had the chance to think about it. ‘Hopefully tomorrow at 5pm – or when I get home tomorrow – I will look back on it. ‘But right now I’ve not had the chance to go, “This will be great”. I’ve not given it a thought.’","Lee McCulloch says Rangers must finish in the play-off positions .

55,"London (CNN)An 18-year-old British man has been arrested on suspicion of preparing to join ISIS in Syria, UK police say. Counterterrorism officers arrested the man at his home in Hodge Hill, in the city of Birmingham, early Monday, West Midlands police said. ""The operation was pre-planned and intelligence led. There was no immediate threat to public safety,"" they said in a statement. The arrest follows that of three teenagers from northwest London on Sunday after they were intercepted by Turkish police in Istanbul. The two 17-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man were arrested ""on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts,"" the Metropolitan Police said. They have since been released on bail. The investigation started Friday, after police learned the two 17-year-olds were missing and were believed to be traveling to Syria. They were traveling with a 19-year-old, police said. British authorities shared intelligence regarding the 17-year-olds with Turkish officials Friday, and that night, they landed in Istanbul on a flight from Barcelona, Spain, a Turkish official told CNN. The teens were stopped with another person seen as suspicious by Turkish intelligence at the airport's risk analysis center, which monitors risky flights and runs checks on suspicious passengers trying to enter Turkey. Turkish authorities questioned the teens, the Turkish official said, and the Metropolitan Police said the three returned to London shortly before midnight Saturday and were arrested. Last week, Turkish authorities said they had arrested a  person -- working for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service -- on suspicion of helping three British girls who are thought to have entered Syria to join ISIS. British police say they think the three east London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- traveled to Syria after flying from London to Istanbul on February 17. Metropolitan Police on Monday announced a new media campaign to deter young people from traveling to Syria. Radio and press advertisements highlighting the influence a mother could have on her daughters would be placed in ethnic minority media, police said. The campaign said that it was mothers who often noticed changes in behavior that could signal an intention to travel to Syria, they said. There was increasing concern about the number of women traveling to Syria, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said. ""It is an extremely dangerous place, and the reality of the lifestyle they are greeted with when they arrive is far from that promoted online by terrorist groups,"" she said. ""The option of returning home is often taken away from them, leaving families at home devastated and with very few options to secure a safe return for their loved one,"" Ball said.","Metropolitan Police announce a media campaign to deter young people from traveling to Syria .

56,"A man was left with horrific scars after his abusive wife poured a jug of scalding water over him after a rowed about household chores. Ken Gregory, 65, suffered first and second degree burns to 14% of his body after the assault at his £295,000 bungalow in Peterborough in March last year. A year on, pictures of his injuries show painful blistering stretching from his scalp to his lower back - and some of the scars will never fade. Scroll down for video . Ken Gregory was left horrifically scarred after his now ex-wife threw boiling water over him   in March last year . Mr Gregory met Teresa Gilbertson (pictured together) through ballroom dancing, but they relationship became sour after five years of marriage . His ex-wife Teresa Gilbertson, 60, is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following the attack. Mr Gregory has decided to speak out because he believes it is important to challenge the stigma surrounding men who are victims of abuse. Retired BT manager Mr Gregory said: 'Being attacked by a woman is nothing to be ashamed of.' 'I had never imagined something like this would happen to me. 'As a man who is a bit older and who isn't exactly small, there is a perception that you can't be a victim of domestic violence. 'I was worried that people would assume that it was my fault and she was the victim - there is still a general perception that, as a strong man against a weaker female, you must have been the protagonist. A year on, the retired BT manager is speaking out to challenge the stigma surrounding men who are victims of abuse. Pictured, Mr Gregory with the jug his ex-wife used . Mr Gregory's ex-wife Teresa Gilbertson, 60, is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following the attack. Pictured, injuries to his back (left) and shoulder (right) 'But it should be the same message that they put out for women many years ago: don't be frightened, you don't have to put up with it.' The couple met through ballroom dancing following the death of Mr Gregory's first wife   of more than 30 years, Maureen, seven years ago. But after five years of marriage, their relationship soured. On the day of the attack on March 23, Mr Gregory had been due to take flowers to his late wife's memorial to mark her birthday.  Instead the couple rowed over finances and household chores. Eventually, they reached an apparently mutual  decision to get a divorce and Gilbertson had offered to make a cup of tea. Mr Gregory, who has limited mobility due to arthritis, turned down the offer, but his wife left the room and returned with a jug of freshly boiled water. Peterborough Crown Court heard she told him 'there you go' after tipping it over his head without warning. It was the culmination of escalating verbal abuse. Three weeks earlier, Mr Gregory needed hospital treatment after Gilbertson threw a cup of tea over him while he slept, in what she claimed was an accident. When police arrived following the final incident, Mr Gregory said she told officers: 'If I'd wanted to kill him, I'd have used a knife.' Reliving the incident, Mr Gregory said: 'I was sitting with my back to her and it came without warning. 'It was unbearable, searing pain - I'd never known anything like it. 'Afterwards I could barely sleep as I couldn't lie on my back.' Mr Gregory, who has limited mobility due to arthritis, said the injuries meant he barely sleep after the attack . Experts told the trial that the pattern of the injuries showed the water must have been poured deliberately - and not by accident. Mr Gregory said: 'From the start, the police took it very seriously and even our mutual friends were able to see that I was the innocent party. 'If other men find themselves in this position, I would say don't be embarrassed or ashamed - my case goes to show that this can happen to anybody.' Detective Inspector Mark Woolner, from Cambridgeshire Police's domestic abuse unit, said the force has specially-trained officers who support both male and female victims of domestic violence. He said:  'Men affected by domestic abuse often feel that they won't be taken seriously, but this simply isn't the case.'

58,"Lewis Hamilton hailed his crew of mechanics following a difficult day at the office that he claims left him 'heavily compromised' ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix. Fresh from an Australian Grand Prix 'triple crown' of pole position, fastest lap and race win, Hamilton was forced to pull his Mercedes to one side after just four installation laps in the first practice session at the Sepang International Circuit. Mercedes mechanics fix Lewis Hamilton's car at the team's garage after its engine failure on Friday . After the car was hauled back to the garage there were initial fears an engine change may be required, only for the fault to lie within the power unit inlet system. The depth of the issue within the system, however, meant Hamilton did not return to the track until 38 minutes into the 90 of FP2. But the 30-year-old wasted no time in getting up to speed as he went on to set the fastest lap, being the only driver to dip under 100 seconds with a time of one minute 39.790secs. 'It was an amazing job done by my guys to rebuild the car, get the engine and gearbox back on and to get back out,' said Hamilton. 'I am very grateful for that. Especially here where it is so hot and so difficult for the tyres, so it was really important get back out.' Hamilton overcame the engine problems in the morning practice session to set the fastest time . Losing too much time, however, may yet prove costly as Hamilton added: 'It affects you quite a bit. 'Fortunately I got a few laps in with a longer run at the end, but in terms of my set-up, I have not made any changes and it is quite a bit off from where we need it. 'Overall, my preparations have been heavily compromised. Whenever you lose a session, and most of the second session too, that definitely doesn't help. 'In the end, just to get some laps was crucial. If I had missed all of today then Sunday would be hard. 'Right now I have some improvements to make to the balance and the settings, so I am sure we will tweak and improve it because we have not got the car dialled in.' But the British world champion says his Malaysian Grand Prix preparations have been 'heavily compromised' Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was second quickest in both sessions, the Finn finishing 0.373secs adrift of Hamilton's team-mate Nico Rosberg in FP1, and remarkably exactly the same time off the Briton in FP2. Although Ferrari are showing signs of closing in on Mercedes, Raikkonen said: ""The car is still not perfect, but I'm sure we can improve for tomorrow. 'We have some work to do on the set up to make everything easier, but we'll do our best and we'll see where we end up in qualifying.' Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen during practice for the Malaysian Formula One Grand Prix on Friday . Rosberg had to settle for third best, just over four tenths of a second behind Hamilton, followed by Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat and Williams duo Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa. As for ailing McLaren, the returning Fernando Alonso was down in 16th, 2.7secs off the pace, closely followed by team-mate Jenson Button. Alonso, who sat out the first race Down Under as he recovered from concussion suffered in a crash in testing, claims McLaren have progressed from where they were a fortnight ago in Melbourne. The double world champion said: ""It felt great in the car. 'After the gym, the simulator, whatever you do it is not the same as the car, so I enjoyed so much driving here. Fernando Alonso returns to the track after recovering from concussion he suffered in Australia crash . 'It was really the second day of testing for me because I had one good day in Barcelona with 63 laps and then today with 45 laps. 'And the car was much better than expected. The experience we had in winter we had a lot of problems after four or five laps. 'But today we ran 45 laps with zero problems, everything went as we predicted. 'We will see in qualifying where we are, but I think we were 4.6 seconds behind pole position in Australia. 'Here, maybe we could be 3.5 seconds down, so that is a one second or 1.5 second gain in two weeks, so a big step forward.' Alonso claims McLaren have progressed from where they were a fortnight ago in Melbourne . Manor also hit the track for the first time this season after months of uncertainty and missing Australia due to technical issues despite being present at the Albert Park circuit. Rookie duo Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi completed 34 laps between them, with the Briton 5.9secs down and the Spaniard 7.4secs adrift, with the latter's day cut short by a spin into the gravel.","Lewis Hamilton missed Friday's first session and some of the second .

60,"A two-year-old boy will receive revolutionary treatment for his rare disease after a mystery benefactor donated £40,000. Kat Musgrove had 30 days to find £140,000 so her son Kian could fly to the U.S and have his neuroblastoma treated. She was struggling to raise the final bit of money until an anonymous donor from Luxembourg stepped in. Kian Musgrove, two,  will receive revolutionary treatment for his rare cancer after a mystery benefactor donated £40,000 . Neuroblastoma is the cancer of specialised nerve cells, also known as neural crest cells. It is the second most common childhood tumour. The symptoms range from tiredness to lack of appetite and pain in the bones. Most children who are diagnosed with the condition are younger than five years old. Treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and antibody treatment. Almost half of neuroblastoma cases are an aggressive form and, despite very intensive treatment, it has a high chance of returning. It affects around 100 children every year. The 27-year-old, from Newcastle, said: 'I can't believe it. There was a note with the money saying ""good luck to your son"". 'I still can't get my head around it. I keep looking to make sure the money is actually there.' Kian will fly to Michigan for the treatment on March 31. He was first diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma on October 31, 2013, after doctors discovered 27 tumours around his kidneys and in his bones. Despite chemotherapy and numerous operations Kian still had an 80 per cent chance the cancer would return, doctors said. The new trial treatment - called DFMO - aims to prevent the cancer returning by stopping a certain cell that creates the neuroblastoma cell. His mother Kat (centre) had just 30 days to find £140,000 so Kian could fly to Michigan and have the trial treatment. Above, with sister Katie (left) Kian was first diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma on October 31, 2013, after doctors discovered 27 tumours around his kidneys and in his bones . But it has to be started no later than 120 days after the patient has undergone their last bout of immunotherapy - and Kian's finished almost 100 days ago. Ms Musgrove, who is in the process of booking her flights, said: 'I'm so excited by what has happened, people have just been incredible. 'I want this for Kian so much and I want this to work so badly. 'But I'm also scared. Scared because I'm flying over there alone, not knowing what the future is going to hold.' Kian's family will continue to raise £500,000 for 'relapse therapy' in case the trial treatment does not work and the cancer returns. Above, mother and son are pictured together before the trip .

62,"There have been all manner of World Cup shambles for England since they should have won the 1992 final here in Australia. But never one as bad as this. This, surely, is the worst yet, worse than 1996 when Sri Lanka’s pinch-hitters left them trailing in their wake. Worse, even, than 1999 when England were eliminated from their own World Cup the day before the official song came out. And it is certainly worse than the last three World Cups when we had come to expect England to struggle in the one-day game, particularly in 2007 and last time when the biggest tournament in limited-overs cricket followed the Ashes.

England batsman Moeen lays on the ground after being run out by Bangladesh wicketkeeper Rahim during the World Cup match . The 15-run defeat here by Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval, which confirmed England’s abject surrender, is nothing short of an utter humiliation, an embarrassment that, not for the first time in recent years, leaves them as the laughing stock of world cricket. This was the World Cup that England were supposed to take seriously and prepare thoroughly for. This was the World Cup that the Ashes were moved for, leading to a 5-0 thrashing last winter and all manner of painful recriminations. Yet so far advanced has the one-day game progressed in the last two years since England reached the Champions Trophy final that clearing the calendar and playing only one-day cricket so far this winter has been akin to trying to put a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. England have been able to defeat just Scotland in this tournament and after being thrashed by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka they have now been humbled by a team in Bangladesh who are little more than minnows themselves. This tournament was set up to virtually guarantee the progress of the big eight teams to the quarter-finals. It was almost impossible for England to fail to at least get to the last eight where defeat would have been far from a disgrace. Or so it seemed. Instead this is a defeat that deserves to be considered as a total disgrace. It is one that leaves Peter Moores fighting to salvage his reputation as a credible coach of England and Paul Downton, the man who appointed him, facing huge questions about the big decisions he has made. When the dust settles and England have gone through the motions of their last group match against Afghanistan they must have a searching examination of how they play one-day cricket and how they can possibly catch up with the rest of the world before they host the next World Cup in four years time. It is not just Moores and Downton with much to contemplate. Senior players such as Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson have not provided the proper example needed from senior players in a young team and should retire from one-day cricket to allow a new young vibrant team to be built. And the decision to replace Alastair Cook with Eoin Morgan as one-day captain on the brink of this tournament has backfired, the new leader falling for his fifth duck in his last nine innings just when his team needed him most. Morgan has been given permission to miss England’s first one-day international after this World Cup, against an Ireland team having a far better tournament than England, so he can play in the Indian Premier League. That decision frankly stinks and if Morgan does not want to lead England into a new one-day era then he should give up the job now and let Joe Root, who was seriously considered when Cook was sacked, lead them from now on. Never mind that Jos Buttler almost rescued England after they had fallen to 163 for six chasing 275. And never mind that TV umpire Simon Fry gave an atrocious decision to rule that Chris Jordan had been run out when surely there was doubt over whether his bat had bounced up once he had made his ground.

Moores went into full Graham Taylor mode on the sidelines, raging at the fourth official after a truly awful decision, but in truth England did not deserve to get away with this. They were second best to a tigerish Bangladesh just as they have been worse than second best throughout this tournament. And it all started off so well too. It looked as though England were going to have an easy night when Anderson found the bite and swing that had eluded him in this tournament to take two wickets in his first seven balls. Neither Imrul Kayes nor Tamim Iqbal, the dangerman at the top of the Bangladesh order, could cope as England made a start full of the sort of aggression and purpose that the seriousness of their plight demanded. Yet England could not have expected the resistance and then blossoming strokeplay that came from a batsman who had never made a one-day international century before in Mahmudullah. The drop-in pitch at the re-built Adelaide Oval may have been near perfect for batting but the lack of variety in an England attack that has struggled for penetration in this World Cup allowed Bangladesh to flourish. Mahmudullah found a willing ally in the tiny form of Mushfiqur Rahim, the Bangladeshi ‘mighty atom’ who first faced England as a 16-year-old schoolboy 10 years ago, and together they preyed on England’s nerves. Mahmudullah certainly enjoyed becoming the first Bangladeshi to record a hundred in a World Cup match and while he and Rahim were adding 141 for the fifth wicket a total beyond 300 looked within his side’s reach. That they fell 25 short of that was down to much improved death bowling from England, Chris Jordan in particular showing how it should be done after being preferred to Steven Finn in this winner takes all match. It should have been well within England’s reach but their chase was old-fashioned and flawed with Bell, involved in a schoolboy run out that saw the demise of Moeen Ali, leaving them far too much to do after he had taken 82 balls to reach 63. The dismissals of Bell and Morgan in four balls from Rubel Hossain, faster than any England bowler, left England deep in the mire and even though Buttler, their main glimmer of hope for a better one-day future, hit 65 off 52 balls they ended up 16 short. The brilliant Hossain finished it by bowling both Broad and Anderson in three balls in the penultimate over, leaving Chris Woakes stranded on 42, to spark off wild Bangladeshi celebrations.

'I called the council number and they sent an Armourguard guy to listen at seven or eight in the morning,' Clark told Stuff.co.nz. 'He noted that it was on and it was annoying and objectionable but Alistair wasn't there. He wasn't even in the house. Alistair Hey, a 57-year-old man who lives in a plush Queenstown neighbourhood in New Zealand, was sentenced to 70 hours of community work last week for assaulting Tim Clark . 'About 5pm in the afternoon I saw his garage door was open. I walked out and he was at the top of the access road with the spray bottle.' Clark said he approached Hey and politely asked him to turn down the music. However, after asking him for a third time, Hey turned on Clark and sprayed him straight in the face with weed killer.

65,"The oldest known Roman camp has been discovered in Italy's northeastern border, revealing clues to how the ancient civilisation gained its military prowess. Italian scientists say the fort may have been used to fight off pirates 2,000 years ago and possibly paved the way for the modern Italian city of Trieste. Researchers discovered the structure, built in 178 BC, using Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) – a technology which uses pulsed lasers to measure distances to the Earth. Lidar  revealed the oldest known Roman military camp called San Rocco.  Italian scientists say the fort may have been used by to fight off pirates 2,000 years ago, paving the way for what is today the city of Trieste . A scanner was placed aboard a helicopter which then flew over parts of Muggia Bay. A laser then sent out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second. A sensor recorded the light to measure a range, which was combined with position and orientation data from GPS to create a 3D map. The method allows researchers to reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways. 'After seeing the image of the first Roman camp, [Federico Bernardini] ran to the site, 30 minutes from our institute, to search for direct evidence,' study co-author Claudio Tuniz, from the Fermi Center in Rome told Live Science. 'After a brief stroll through the site, he found clear signatures of the Roman period.' These included hobnails used to make the military shoes of Roman soldiers and fragments of Roman amphorae, widely used to store oil, wine and other food products. Pictured is a Lidar-derived digital terrain model of the fort. Red represents surviving emerging features. The black circles indicate the main pre-Roman sites of the area . After spotting the site using Lidar, researchers then explored the area on foot to find several Roman artefacts. Pictured is military footwear hobnail from Grociana piccola . Flying above the intended target area, Lidar works by sending out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second. When a laser is pointed at a targeted area on the ground, the beam of light is reflected by the surface it hits. A sensor then records the light to measure a range. When laser ranges are combined with position and orientation data from GPS the result is a dense, detail-rich 3D map. The pulsed light can reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways. Lidar mapping was originally used to provide intelligence after earthquakes, military spying and for river erosion detection. Around 32 acres (13 hectares) in size, the structure was defended by fortifications, such as ramparts up to about 80 feet (25 metres) wide. The main fort was on a hilltop 1.2 miles (2km) from the shore of the Bay of Muggia, and was flanked by two minor forts either side. The fort was built in 178 BC, making it several decades older than any other Roman fort ever found. Up until now, the oldest Roman military camps found had been located in Numantia and Pedrosillo in Spain, dating to 154 B.C. and 155 B.C., respectively. The find has excited researchers studying the Roman Empire as the timing of building of the fort coincides with the second Istrian War. The early Romans were keen to protect a settlement called Tergeste - which grew to become Trieste - from the people to the north which the Romans referred to as pirates. The Romans lost the first war, and the building of the fort suggests they were quite serious about winning the second.

The hope is that further study of the fort will offer clues about the very beginnings of the Roman army and how it came to become such a powerful force. Archaeologists also say that further analysis could lead to direct evidence connecting the fort with a fort that mentioned by the Roman historian Livy. Livy reported that the pirates found wine inside the camp and got drunk, and this helped the Romans reconquer the area. Researchers now plan to do full-scale excavations at the site.

67,"A second Western Australian man has come forward to claim he was the target of a cruel Facebook hoax involving a photo of a person urinating on a war memorial. The image of a young man desecrating on a tribute went viral on social media, aiming to shame the person responsible. 'This is Liam Powell from Perth, western [sic] Australia urinating on a war memorial - share if you're disgusted,' the image was captioned. However, the wrong person was vindicated in the campaign. It has since been revealed that the photo was taken in England six years ago and the real culprit was 19-year-old named Philip Laing. Contrary to the caption, this Facebook image really shows Mr Laing, 19, soaking the wreaths of poppies in 2009. Liam Powell from Wanneroo in Perth's north is now hoping to clear his name, alleging that he was purposefully identified as the person in the image in an attempt to ruin his reputation. Another Liam Powell, a footballer from East Perth, has already spoken out to allege that he was intentionally victimised by the post. Both are insistent that the post was a personal attack, intended to ruin their reputation. Mr Powell from Wanneroo told Fairfax that he has an ongoing problem with internet trolls. 'This was actually aimed at me,' he told Fairfax, refuting the earlier claims from the East Perth Powell. 'I've had a problem with people on Facebook,' he said but is bewildered as to why he is the supposedly subject of such a cruel bullying campaign. He is feeling victimised after receiving almost 300 mostly nasty comments on Facebook regarding the viral photo. Philip Laing (pictured) pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service . Earlier, the other Mr Powell and his family explained that they felt shamed by the Facebook hoax as they have a military history, WA Today reported. Liam Powell's father, Andrew, said he's been flooded with comments from those who saw the image and the offending caption naming his 17-year-old son, who's an East Perth footballer. 'It's not Liam,' Mr Powell told WA Today. 'It's embarrassing for our family.' Mr Powell says he was particularly upset by the image due to his long military history. He says his father was in the navy, his grandfather was in the Second World War and his great-grandfather also fought in the Boer War. 'Even though it's not him [Liam Powell], I feel ashamed because people think it's him,' Mr Powell said. The real culprit, 19-year-old Mr Laing, caused revulsion in 2009 after he was pictured soaking the wreaths of poppies during a mass student bar crawl in the UK. The student, who pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service. Laing, is thought to have no memory of the urinating incident, which happened on a night out in 2009 when Mr Laing has been buying drinks for £1 (about AUS $2). He was ordered to pay £185 (about AUS $366) in prosecution costs. The real culprit, Mr Laing, told probation officers back in 2009 that he had been buying drinks for £1 (about AUS $2) on the night .

69,"Italian fashion designers Dolce and Gabbana have insisted they 'respect all the world' after their controversial remarks on fertility treatments infuriated Sir Elton John. The pop star called for a boycott of the famous brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised in-vitro fertilization (IVF), which sparked outrage on social media. But Dolce has now insisted his views were private, personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional Sicilian family. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Designer Domenico Dolce (right) has defended his controversial remarks and said he 'respects all the world'. He is pictured with business partner Stefano Gabbana (left) Boycott: Sir Elton John (pictured with his husband David Furnish and their children), spoke out against Dolce and Gabbana and claimed that he will never wear any of their clothes ever again after their comments . In an interview with CNN, Dolce insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure, and said: 'I believe in the traditional family. 'It is impossible to change my culture for something different. It's me...I respect all the world, all the culture.' The fashion designer had previously said: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that. That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies.' That sparked a furious reaction from John, who has two children with husband David Furnish through IVF, who fired back: 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as ""synthetic"". 'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.' His outburst prompted a mass social media campaign, as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand. But Dolce said he would not be not boycotting the artist and added: 'I love the music of Elton John.' He said he believed they could end the dispute and added: 'Every people resolve everything by talk...we start to talk, the problem is resolved. 'Every people [has] freedom for choosing what they want. This for me is democracy. I respect you because you choose what you want. 'I respect me because I choose what I want. This just my point of private view.' Interview: Dolce made his inflammatory remarks in an interview with Italian magazine Panorama earlier this month . The fashion designer also said they respected how people chose to live their lives, including the use of IVF, and said others should also respect differences in opinion. Gabbana insisted the duo were not telling anyone how to live their lives and added: 'We love gay couple. We are gay. We love gay couple. We love gay adoption. We love everything. It's just an express of my private point of view.' And when he was if he supported having children through the in-vitro procedure, he responded: 'Yeah, I don't have anything bad, because the beauty of the world is freedom.' However, Gabbana admitted they could have expressed themselves using better language to the Italian magazine that printed the interview, but said they were shocked by the social media backlash. He added: 'Boycott Dolce & Gabbana for what? They don't think like you? This is correct? This is not correct. We are in 2015. This is like medieval. It's not correct.' Furious: Sir Elton posted a photo of design duo Dolce & Gabbana on his Instagram page and responded to their comments in a strongly-worded attack . Following John's outburst, several Hollywood celebrities tweeted their support including Ricky Martin, former tennis player Martina Navratilova and creator of TV show 'Glee,' Ryan Murphy. Victoria Beckham, a former Dolce and Gabbana ambassador who is now close friends with Sir Elton, led the outpouring of support with the message: ''Sending love to Elton David Zachary Elijah & all the beautiful IVF babies x vb.'

Tyler, 15, received an outpouring of support globally after he uploaded two photos of his Facebook conversation with his father - which took place last December - to his Tumblr account. In the messages, his father apparently wrote that the news his son is gay is an 'embarrassment', he has been left 'shamed' and 'ridiculed' and he feels like he is 'going to puke'. Tyler revealed to Daily Mail Online that he has not seen his dad for three months - and has even moved out of his family's home in Vancouver, Canada, to his aunt's house, also in the city.

Above, the teenager is seen (right, at the back) several years ago with his father, mother, and two sisters in a family photo . The teen said the support he has received following the 'physically painful' Facebook conversation has lifted his spirits and helped him think positively, adding: 'I have no time for tears.' Tyler, whose  mother and two  sisters still live with his father, said: 'I haven't heard from my father at all. I moved out to my aunt's house a few weeks after he sent the messages. 'He sent them a week after I came out during December, and I haven't spoken to him since then. The rest of my family were kind of blown away by how much attention [the photos] have drawn. 'I initially just posted them in anger and disappointment to my Tumblr blog because that is usually where I vent and rant about stuff. I never thought that it was going to [escalate] like this.' He added: 'I visit my mom and sisters whenever my dad is at work.' The teenager said he had known he was gay 'since fifth grade', but had been worried about coming out publicly - particularly because his relationship with his father had been 'rocky for a long time'. 'I had a feeling he wasn't going to like it. But I had to tell him. I couldn't keep it anymore,' he said. In the images, posted on Monday, the father apparently tells his son the news of his sexuality is an 'embarrassment', that he has been left 'shamed' and 'ridiculed' and that he feels like he is 'going to puke' 'This is worse than death': Tyler told Daily Mail Online that he has not seen his dad for three months - and has even moved out of his family's home in Vancouver, Canada, to his aunt's house in the city .

Then, he came out to his mother, who was shocked, but ultimately supported him. Eventually, he told his father. But instead of responding to Tyler in a loving manner, the father apparently sent a series of offensive Facebook messages to his son, reading: ‘We took care of you since you were a baby. 'We loved you, took care of you when you’re sick. Lost many days and nights in all your fifteen years. Now this is what we get in return, shame and embarrassment. 'If only you didn't reject God and His teachings in your life you could have been strong enough to stay from evil and scums that surrounds you. Stay away.' In further messages, perhaps in response to the Tumblr post - which Tyler initially posted in December before it went viral this month - he added: 'Take out your post from social media. 'You embarrass me from all the people I knew. I'm going to puke. Whatever you do it reflects on me. People will ridicule me, insult me, and I might turn out to be a criminal.' Despite his father's reaction to his coming out, Tyler told Daily Mail Online that all of his other relatives - including the aunt with whom he is staying - and friends were 'supportive and non-judgmental'. 'Even the friends that I thought were going to shun me out accepted me,' he said. In relation to his feelings about his father's reaction, Tyler added: 'I honestly don't have time for being sad. 'I mean, I'm on Spring Break and I have to finish a math booklet and a French speech. [I have] no time for tears. I'm just hoping that that my father will come around.'

He said his mother and older sister 'have mixed feelings' about the attention his post has brought, but his younger sister 'doesn't really mind' because she 'doesn't really know what's happening'. One of the messages of support the teenager has received reads: 'Mate, from the other side of the Atlantic, be proud of how you are born. Hope everything comes around with your dad.' Meanwhile, a Twitter user named Katerina told Tyler: 'Your father is ignorant and he needs some education on many matters, bc I suppose he is not so narrow minded only regarding this.' Another, named Naithom, posted: 'I'm so sorry for the way your dad's handling the situation. Please surround yourself w/ people who love & care for you as you are.'

Can’t even say it to my face smh (shaking my head)' And Marshall Moore told the teenager: 'Just read about your story. Different generation but I still get it. Stay strong and please don't give up on yourself. Love wins.' Mr Moore added in a separate online post: 'Every time I see a story like this, I foam at the mouth. The world should've moved on by now. Obviously it hasn't.' Pensioner Jacqui Christensen also spoke out in support of Tyler, saying: 'I'm a 75 year old woman, mother to three children. Be proud of who you are. What your father is saying is so unfair.' She added: 'People choose to have children. Caring for them is part of the deal. Parents should respect who that child is; what he becomes.'

71,"The BBC has boasted of making ‘vast’ cuts to its celebrity wage bill – but still paid stars a total of nearly £188million last year. Its 14 highest-paid presenters, thought to include Graham Norton, Chris Evans and John Humphrys, took home nearly £12million between them, figures show. A further 230 were paid between £100,000 and £500,000. The figures appear in a report commissioned by its governing body, the BBC Trust, which congratulated the corporation on the ‘great’ progress it has made in cutting its celebrity wage bill. Some of the BBC's highest paid presenters, who are thought to include Graham Norton, left, and Chris Evans, right, took home nearly £12million in pay between them . The corporation has reduced the amount it spends on talent by 15 per cent over the past six financial years, and cut its spend on so-called ‘top talent’ – those earning £100,000 a year or more – by 29 per cent. However, it also slashed the number of presenters on screen or radio by around a third over the same period. In the report, seen by the Daily Mail, the BBC congratulated itself on the ‘vast improvements’ it has made since 2008, and the ‘cultural shift’ the BBC has made in allowing itself to lose certain presenters to other channels. It said: ‘There has been a considerable and important internal cultural shift towards greater ownership and scrutiny of talent costs…and a willingness to be more flexible in its approach to talent, including allowing talent to leave where appropriate.’ John Humphrys, left, is thought to another one of the BBC's top earners. The report also highlighted presenters who had left the BBC such as Susanna Reid, right . The report highlighted Jake Humphrey, who moved to BT Vision, and Susanna Reid, the former BBC Breakfast presenter who now co-hosts Good Morning Britain for ITV. But the scale of the salaries the BBC continues to pay out to presenters is unlikely to ease concerns that the BBC is ‘profligate’ with licence fee payers’ money. Last week, the influential Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee slammed the BBC, painting a portrait of an organisation that was inept with public funds, and had blown billions on vanity projects and staff pay-offs. John Whittingdale, chairman of the committee, said last night that the salaries the BBC was awarding talent needed close scrutiny. He explained: ‘The BBC should think long and hard before paying anybody a six-figure-plus salary. It is very hard to justify these sorts of sums. 'If the argument is that [the presenters] would go elsewhere - well, then perhaps the BBC should let them. New BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead is to make a speech in Oxford today, where she is expected to reinforce concerns that the BBC wage bill was too high . 'If somebody becomes so successful that they command a very large salary, the BBC is not there to stop them. It is there as an incubator of talent.' The committee's report, Future of the BBC, also called for the abolition of the BBC Trust, saying that the governing body was too close to the Corporation and needed to be replaced with a more rigorous body. A speech by Rona Fairhead, in Oxford today is likely to reinforce some of their concerns. ‘The Trust recognises that the outstanding people on screen and on air are at the heart of the BBC, at the same time we are clear that the BBC has a responsibility to spend money wisely in its approach to talent pay,’ she will say. Mrs Fairhead is also at the centre of another controversy about pay, after it emerged that she received more than £500,000 last year for just 50 days work in non-executive roles at the embattled bank, HSBC.","The BBC has boasted of making 'vast' cuts to its wage bill during last year .

72,"A 22-year-old man bought a coin that he believes could date back more than 2,000 years for just £29. Coin collector Stephen Creswell snapped up what he thinks is a half shekel from Tyre - which dates back to 126BC - at an auction in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire. The coins are believed by Biblical scholars to have been the same as those used to pay Judas Iscariot his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. Lost treasure? The coin found by Stephen Creswell, 22, which he believes to be half a shekel from Tyre . Collector: Mr Creswell, pictured, bought the coin for just £29 at an auction in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire . But one expert claims the coin is unlikely to be an original and believes Mr Cresswell might have a 'mock up'. The battered coin weighs 7.7grams, half of a full shekel's weight. The earliest reference of the coin comes in 126BC and it is understood that they remained in circulation. Shekels were used for temple tax in ancient Jerusalem due to their relatively higher concentration of silver than other Roman coins. In Matthew 27:3 it is said: 'Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders...' In some translations of the bible, the word 'silver' is replaced with 'shekels'. Mr Creswell, from Dudley, West Midlands said that he bought the coin as part of a selection but quickly realised he had 'something special'. He said: 'As soon as I saw how old it was I knew I had something special on my hands. I had no idea what it was though until I typed it in to the search engine. 'I'm not really a coin collector, but I just love to grab a bargain.' But after looking at images of the coin, one expert said he does not believe it to be a shekel as Mr Cresswell had hoped. Payment: The coins are believed by Biblical scholars to have been the same as those used to pay Judas Iscariot his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus, illustrated in this image above . Professional numismatist Mike Vosper told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that this is not even a coin but either a contemporary forgery, although this is doubtful, or more like a modern mock up of a ""coin"" believed to be some kind of shekel.' Mr Vosper, who runs Mike R Vosper Coins with his partner Viv, said it was the fabric of the coin and the fact that it has half its surface missing that gives it away. Viv added: 'Some coins have surface deposits but nothing like that'. Mr Vosper added that coins such as that is not likely to be found in the UK. The coin, if real, could fetch up to £500 if it was to be sold. Mr Creswell has no intention of selling it on as it reminds me of playing with artifacts when he was younger.

Mr Cresswell started attending auctions as a teenager and said he loved their competitive nature.

73,"It is said that you can learn a lot about someone from their handshake - but it appears they may be learning far more about you than we have perhaps ever realised. Scientists have discovered that the traditional sign of friendship is actually a way for us to get a good sniff of someone we have just met. They found that humans unconsciously use the touch from a handshake as a way to sample smelly chemicals from each other. Scroll down for videos of the experiments conducted by the researchers . A firm handshake may also be a way of sampling the scent of the person you have just met, say scientists . In a study using hidden cameras, researchers observed people as they greeted each other with and without handshakes. Those that grasped hands upon meeting then touched their faces and around their nose far more often afterwards compared to a greeting where there was no physical contact. A high-five or fist bump may not be the most formal way of greeing someone, but they have one advantage over a handshake, say experts - they are better for our health. A British study has found that slapping palms together at head height passes on fewer than half as many germs as the traditional greeting. For the study, two Aberystwyth University researchers donned thick rubber gloves and one dipped his hand in a bacterial soup before shaking the other’s hand. The number of bugs transmitted to the second glove was counted and the contact area measured. Then the procedure was repeated with high-fives and also with the even trendier fistbump, which involves two balled fists being gently and briefly rapped together. The high-five was more hygienic than the handshake but the fistbump was the cleanest of all, transferring around one-twentieth of the bugs of the handshake. It is thought that the brevity of the action and the smaller contact area helped slash transmission. The scientists believe that the face touching is a way of subtly sniffing the hand used in the handshake and it was particularly prevalent when greeting people of the same sex. Professor Noam Sobel, chair of neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science, who led the research, said: 'It is well-known that we emit odours that influence the behaviour and perception of others but, unlike other mammals, we don't sample those odours from each other overtly. 'Instead, our experiments reveal handshakes as a discreet way to actively search for social chemosignals.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal eLife, believe their findings may provide some hints at why handshakes first evolved to become a greeting and cementing a friendship. It has since become a way of sealing a deal and even a sign of sportsmanship. Limp and damp handshakes are often seen as being an unattractive trait. But they may also provide us with unconscious olfactory clues about the other person. Many other animals use smell as a key part of learning more about each other, such as dogs that will regularly sniff each other upon greeting. Idan Frumin, a neurologist at the Weizmann Institute who also conducted the research, said: 'It is quite possible that ""boardroom etiquette"" is actually a later explanation for an early type of behaviour that appeared in order to compensate for scarcity of physical contact between human individuals. 'As we don’t overtly sniff each other like other mammals, we needed a way to pass olfactory data between our peers. The handshake might be the best way to convey chemosignals.' The scientists secretly filmed 271 people as they greeted one of 20 members of the research team in a hospital setting. They found that subjects who shook hands with people of the same sex sniffed their right hand twice as much than if they had not shaken hands. When members of the opposite sex greeted, participants sniffed their right hand far less than before a handshake but tended to sniff their left 'non-shaking' hand more often. The participants in the study were filmed in a hospital, shown above) greeting researchers and were found to sniff their fingers and hands considerably more after shaking hands with the person they were meeting . Touching the nose after physical contact (like above) may be a way of smelling chemical signals on others . The researchers believe this may be due to participants unconsciously comparing their own scent to that of the opposite sex. In general the participants placed their hand close to their nose 22 per cent of the time after shaking hands for up to around 17 seconds at a time. They found that increased airflow through a sample of participants nostrils also accompanied the face touching, indicating that they were sniffing. When the scientists added strong artificial odours to wrists of those greeting the participants using scents associated with male or female body odour, the length of time they spent sniffing decreased. However, when they added perfume to the wrists of those greeting, the amount of sniffing , they found the amount of time participants touched their face for doubled. The researchers claim that his may be because artificial odours may mask the chemical signals from a handshake and so it requires more sniffing to detect them. It could also be because the participants found the smells more pleasing than the body odour. However, Mr Frumin said it was still unclear exactly what chemical signals were being exchanged during handshakes. He said: 'For instance, we know from research by Martha McClintock in the 70s that women tend to synchronize their menstrual cycles. 'A signal may be transferred between women to drive that effect. We also know that the choice of a mate is influenced by a person having a compatible immune system. 'Such data could potentially be transferred skin-to-skin contact via a handshake. But these are speculations and a more rigorous analysis is needed to explore these possibilities.'","Scientists at Israel's Weizmann Institute secretly filmed strangers meeting .

75,"A freshman basketball player with rare brain cancer who made it through full season despite being given only a few months to live is now having problems swallowing as her condition worsens. During her senior year of high school, Lauren Hill was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent. But she still made it through a full season at the Cincinnati university while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor she has. Scroll down for video . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19 (pictured), made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . Her mother Lisa updates her followers on her Facebook page about her daughter's progress and said this week that Lauren was having trouble swallowing, although her humor and bravery are shining through. She posted: 'Lauren sleeps about 12 hours a day and still does not like to take naps. 'Her appetite is not as big as it use to be. She has been having increased issues with swallowing. We had to add some thickener to her water to make it easier to swallow. Food we cut down into bite sizes these days to prevent chocking.' Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . She said her daughter's pain medication has been increased to help her deal with headaches and aches across her body. She added: 'She still has a sense of humor even if her legs give out and she falls. My favorite quote of the week.... ""I didn't fall, I gracefully assaulted the floor."" Got to love her.' Despite the diagnosis, Hill decided to attend college and play for the Division III school. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The Team: The Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team (pictured) held its postseason banquet in a hospital room with Hill . The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Life: Doctors didn't expect Hill (center at hospital) to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain .","Lauren Jill has DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent .

77,"A middle-aged man and woman have been found dead in a £350-a-night luxury hotel room after allegedly forming a suicide pact. The bodies of the pair, who were not believed to have been married, were discovered in the same hotel room at The Forbury Hotel in Reading, Berkshire, on Monday. Police confirmed the man, who is in his 60s, and woman, in her 50s, were both pronounced dead at the scene and said their deaths were being treated as 'unexplained but not suspicious'. The bodies of the man, who was in his 60s, and the woman, in her 50s, were discovered in the same room at The Forbury Hotel in Reading, Berkshire (above). Police said the deaths were 'unexplained but not suspicious' The Forbury Hotel, which boasts of 'an indulgent and relaxing experience', remained sealed off yesterday while forensic specialists carried out their investigations. Thames Valley Police confirmed today that both the man and woman's next of kin had been informed of the discovery. A spokesman for Berkshire Coroner's Office said the names of the couple could not be released as they were yet to be formally identified. It is understood paramedics were called to the grade II listed hotel yesterday afternoon when a chambermaid discovered the bodies after the pair failed to check out. The door to their room remained locked and after the worker gained entry, she raised the alarm. The manager of the hotel refused to discuss the incident when contacted by MailOnline today. It is believed the pair may have hatched a plan to kill themselves and may have taken an overdose. Guests at the hotel told how the pair, who checked into the hotel on Sunday evening and booked a double room for the night, may have been suffering severe illness. It was believed the couple, who are said to live in a nearby town, decided to splash out on some luxury where they could spend their final hours. One hotel guest, who asked not to be named, said: 'Apparently it was quite obvious to the paramedics and police who were called that they intended to commit suicide. 'We have been told that they were a fairly local couple and that both were very ill - the woman more seriously so than the man. 'We were told that there was a lot of paraphernalia around in the room and also a note explaining what they were doing. 'I guess all the details will come out in the inquest into their deaths.' Other guests checking out of the five-star hotel today spoke of their shock at the incident. A man aged in his 50s, who was staying at the hotel while in Reading on business, said: 'It is just shocking and so sad. I only checked in last night, so I missed the emergency services but I read about what happened. 'I really feel for them, it is just tragic that they felt they could not go on.' The luxury hotel boasts of 'an indulgent and relaxing experience' on its website (pictured). Rooms cost up to £350-a-night and each comes complete with Egyptian cotton sheets and complementary branded toiletries . A 35-year-old man, who works in the area, added: 'I saw all the police cars and ambulances here yesterday as I only work around the corner. I actually thought someone had been murdered. 'You just never expect something like that to happen around here and at such an upmarket hotel. I guess perhaps if it was a double suicide, they wanted to go out in style in nice surroundings, it is a lovely hotel - not to sound insensitive at all, but it is known for being among the best in the area. 'I just hope the staff who found them are okay, that must have been very traumatic.' A woman aged in her 30s, who was at the hotel with her mother, said: 'It is such a sad tale. It is devastating to think they felt they had nothing left to live for.' The hotel has 23 rooms and a series of 16 apartments, which it lets out. Each room has Egyptian cotton sheets on all king size beds, with complementary Molton Brown toiletries and Nespresso coffee machines in every bedroom. Thames Valley Police confirmed that both bodies were discovered in the same hotel room. A spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police were called to The Forbury Hotel in Forbury Square, Reading, yesterday at 2.39pm to reports of two people found dead in the hotel. 'A man in his 60s and woman in her 50s were confirmed deceased at the scene. Their next of kin have been informed. 'The deaths are currently being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. The investigation will be passed to the coroner. 'Post mortem examinations on both bodies will be carried out at the Royal Berkshire Hospital and an inquest will be opened and adjourned. 'We can confirm that the deaths are not being treated as suspicious and no-one else is being sought in connection with them.' Inquests into the deaths are due to be opened and adjourned by the end of the week.","Man and woman found dead in luxury hotel room at The Forbury, Reading .

Researchers found those from disadvantaged families were far less likely to study and score highly in English, maths, science, humanities and languages. Pupils who do not take these so-called ‘facilitating’ subjects have less chance of obtaining a place at the prestigious Russell Group universities, which often favour them. Bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher A-level subjects, a study shows (file picture) Researchers commissioned by the Department of Education at Oxford University also found poor children are much less likely to get three A-levels in any courses. The wide-ranging study also showed that going to a decent nursery, reading for pleasure and attending an outstanding school can boost a disadvantaged pupil's chances of getting good results. Taking part in school trips and getting into a daily homework routine can also help them. The research is based on data drawn from more than 3,000 young people who have been tracked from the age of three for the Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary Education (EPPSE) project. Researchers found that just a third of bright but disadvantaged students took one of more A-levels facilitating subjects, compared to 58 per cent of their wealthier peers with the same academic ability. Less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a B in these subjects, compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates. The findings also show that just over 35 per cent of the sixth-formers identified as clever based on their test results at age 11 got three A-levels in any subjects, compared to 60 per cent of their high-achieving, richer peers. An analysis of the data found that sixth-formers who did two to three hours of homework each night were nine times more likely to gain three A-levels than those who did none. Less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a B in these subjects, compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates (file picture) The study said: ‘Spending time on homework is likely to reflect both student motivation and engagement, study skills and independence, school policies and the priority teachers attach to encouraging students to study at home (or provide opportunities after school), as well as parental attitudes and support.’ The study concludes that encouraging reading for pleasure, educational trips, the chance to go to a good nursery and school, feedback on school work and a supportive home life can help disadvantaged youngsters to get good results. It suggests that bright, poor students should get ‘enrichment’ vouchers, funded through the Pupil Premium - public funding for disadvantaged children - to help with educational trips, reading for pleasure and studies outside of the classroom. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust which commissioned the report, said: ‘The fact that bright disadvantaged students fall so far behind when they reach their A-levels shows that government and schools urgently need to do more to support able students from less advantaged homes. ‘We must ensure that access to the best schools and opportunities for academic enrichment outside school are available to all students. It is also vital that schools advise their students on the right subject choices at GCSE and A-level so as to maximise their potential.’ Professor Pam Sammons, co-author of the report, said: ‘There is no silver bullet that alone can make a difference but a combination of good schools and pre-schools, the right home learning environment and supportive teachers ready to monitor progress and provide good feedback can all ensure that bright but disadvantaged students get the chance of a good university education. There are important lessons here for teachers and policymakers seeking to reduce the equity gap in attainment.’","Disadvantaged pupils less likely to score well in science and humanities .

80,"A British Airways pilot threatened to kill himself by crashing a jumbo jet five years before the Germanwings disaster in the French Alps last week. Robert Brown killed his wife in a horrific attack with a claw hammer, and the next day he considered deliberately crashing his Boeing 747 in order to 'make a statement'. Now his victim's family say they fear that airlines have not learned from the case and are not making enough effort to assess whether pilots are genuinely fit to fly. Scroll down for video . Parallels: Robert Brown, left, threatened to crash a plane full of passengers just like Andreas Lubitz, right . Victim: Brown killed his estranged wife Joanna, pictured, by repeatedly hitting her with a claw hammer . Brown's case has chilling parallels to that of Andreas Lubitz, who last week flew a plane into the Alps, killing 150 people, after suffering from depression. He had told BA that he was suffering from stress as a result of his divorce from wife Joanna, and consulted his GP about his illness, but carried on working anyway. In October 2010, Brown argued with his wife while dropping off their two children at her home in Ascot, Berkshire, and hit her 14 times with a claw hammer. He then buried her body in Windsor Great Park - but he told his murder trial that he had considered crashing a plane the next day after being harassed by Joanna's lawyers. 'I thought something needs to be done,' Brown said. 'I thought I want to fly one last time and crash the aircraft. I wanted them to be held accountable. 'I thought if I got to work I could crash an aircraft, or fly to Lagos and crash it there or hang myself in the hotel room. I wanted to make a statement.' Sporty: Brown, a British Airways pilot, is pictured on a long-distance run in BA-branded kit . Warning: Joanna's mother Diana Parkes, right, says airlines should have learned from the case . Instead, he called in sick and another pilot stepped in to fly the BA jumbo jet to Nigeria. Brown was arrested later the same day, and subsequently convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 26 years. Joanna's mother, Diana Parkes, told the Daily Telegraph that following the case airlines should ahve done more to ensure that pilots cannot endanger their passengers. She said: 'Robert Brown's claim in court that he planned to ditch a commercial flight the day after he killed her was chilling to hear, and yet there has never been any acknowledgement from British Airways that lessons can be learnt from that.' The victim's best friend Hetti Barkworth-Nanton said that there were 'chilling similarities' between Brown's case and that of Lubitz, who were both fitness fanatics. Brown told his BA bosses that he was feeling stressed out, but they did not follow up the conversation to check that he was in a fit mental state to fly, she said. Plane: Brown had been due to fly a British Airways Boeing 747 similar to this one (file photo) Similarly, Lubitz was apparently signed off from work following a struggle with depression, but ripped up the doctors' notes he was given excusing him from flying. Mrs Barkworth-Nanton told the Telegraph: 'Neither should have been allowed to fly and put the lives of their passengers at risk. In both cases there were things the airlines should have picked up on. The warning signs were there. 'Robert's terrible crime resulted in him taking the life of Jo, but it could have been much worse, and myself and Jo's family feel that airlines are not learning the lessons of these tragedies.' Lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot out of the cockpit during Germanwings flight 4U9525 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf last Tuesday, before deliberately crashing into the Alps killing all 149 other people on board. Work to retrieve the bodies of the victims from the crash site high up in the mountains is continuing six days after the disaster.","Robert Brown killed wife Joanna in 2010 and was due to fly a BA Boeing 747 the next day .

81,"(CNN)Muhammadu Buhari has ruled Nigeria before, as one of a line of military strongmen who dominated the country between 1966 and 1999. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983 -- closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari -- and another military coup ousted him from power in August 1985. Buhari's 20-month rule was known for what he described as a ""war on indiscipline,"" a tough regime which some say was marred by human rights abuses. The 72-year-old  retired major general's experience as a military ruler has been viewed as a plus by some and a minus by others in present-day Nigeria, where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group Boko Haram. This year alone, the extremists have killed at least 1,000 civilians, Human Rights Watch says. The ongoing violence in the Northeast has put security -- along with corruption and the economy -- at the top of the election agenda. Prior to this year's polls in March, Ayo Johnson, a documentary filmmaker and analyst on African affairs, told CNN that voters would opt for whoever could make Nigeria feel safe. ""Many Nigerians will not forget (Buhari) was a military leader, during a dictatorship,"" Johnson said. ""Or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism."" Buhari has campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime, while stressing that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. ""It's a question of security. Whether I was a former military officer or a politician through and through, when there is insecurity of this scale in the country, that takes the priority,"" he said from his campaign plane. In another interview with Amanpour in February, Buhari blamed President Goodluck Jonathan's government for repeated setbacks in the fight against extremists. ""The misappropriation of resources provided by the government for weapons means the Nigerian military is unable to beat Boko Haram,"" he said. Asked by Amanpour about abuses allegedly committed during his own previous leadership, Buhari said there was ""a degree of accuracy"" in the claims. But he said he had ruled Nigeria as part of a military administration. ""When that military administration came under my leadership, we suspended -- as a military then -- part of that constitution that we felt would be difficult for us to operate and as also a consensus,"" he said. ""I think I'm being judged harshly as an individual that what happened during a military administration can be extended under a multiparty democratic system."" Buhari's campaign was fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of ""new broom,"" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. The 2015 presidential race was Buhari's fourth attempt at leadership since he was ousted from power in 1985. In 2003, Buhari -- then with the All Nigeria People's Party --  lost to Olusegun Obasanjo in an election during which EU observers reported widespread irregularities. He lost again to Umaru Yar'Adua in the 2007 election, which was widely condemned for rampant vote-rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. After Yar'Adua's death in 2010, Jonathan rose from vice president to president and Buhari challenged him in the 2011 elections as a candidate from the Congress for Progressive Change. Buhari had helped found the party a year earlier, saying it was ""a solution to the debilitating, ethical and ideological conflicts in my former party, the ANPP."" Buhari is a Muslim from Nigeria's poorer North, while Jonathan hails from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. After Jonathan's victory in 2011, amid accusations of vote-rigging, violent riots broke out in the North. Armed protesters took to the streets chanting Buhari's name, and more than 800 people were killed in the post-election violence. Buhari's office issued a statement calling reports of burning of places of worship places a ""sad, unfortunate and totally unwarranted development."" ""I must say that this is a dastardly act (that) is not initiated by any of our supporters and therefore cannot be supported by our party,"" said Buhari's spokesman Yinka Odumakin. ""I must emphasize that this is purely a political matter, and it should not in any way be turned into an ethnic, religious or regional one."" Read more: Nigeria election -- what you need to know . Ahead of this year's election, Jonathan and Buhari signed a nonviolence pact, the Abuja Accord, in January. On March 26  they renewed their pledge and reiterated their commitment to ""free, fair and credible elections."" But violent protests broke out a day before the final results were announced. Protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state as they marched to protest the elections, amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation. Both candidates called for calm, with Buhari, who contested this year's vote as part of the All Progressives Congress, tweeting: ""Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced."" After the protests in Rivers, his party demanded the elections there be canceled. But Nigeria's electoral commission decided the results would stand, saying it ""did not believe the allegations were substantial enough to require the cancellation/rescheduling"" of the Rivers poll. According to his campaign website, Buhari is from Daura in Nigeria's northern Katsina state and is married with eight children. His military training began in 1963 and included stints in the United Kingdom, India and the United States. Buhari was the first chairman of the Nigerian Petroleum Corporation, the site says. Elements of Buhari's biography were questioned in the run-up to the March 28 election. After weeks of speculation and an ongoing legal battle over allegations that Buhari failed to complete his secondary school education, a Nigerian court on March 25 cleared the way for him to run in the presidential race after adjourning the case until April 22. As a Sunni Muslim from the North, Buhari appears to have moved to address any concerns his appointment could be detrimental to non-Muslim Nigerians -- approximately half the country's population, according to the CIA Factbook. A blog post on his campaign website headed ""Buhari will never Islamise Nigeria"" describes a campaign ceremony in January in Imo state. Imo Gov. Rochas Okorocha, it says, ""dismissed suggestions of plans by Muhammadu Buhari to 'Islamize' Nigeria,"" telling the audience Buhari's long-time cook and driver were Christians and his youngest daughter had married a Christian. Buhari has also not been immune to the violence plaguing northern Nigeria. Last year, he was targeted in a suicide bombing that killed at least 15 people in the city of Kaduna. An earlier blast in the city the same day  had been aimed at a Muslim cleric. A day after winning the country's presidency, Buhari told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that fighting corruption and curbing violence were at the top of his agenda. The economy is another major issue the new leader has to contend with, as the country overtook South Africa last year as the continent's largest economy.  But as many as 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line, surviving on less than a dollar a day.","Muhammadu Buhari is a 72-year-old retired major general from Daura, northern Nigeria .

82,"Two statues of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were unveiled at Canterbury Cathedral today - the first royal sculptures to be installed there during her reign. The monarch arrived at Capel-le-Ferne in Kent this afternoon to open a new £3.5million visitor centre that honours the Battle of Britain war heroes. She then made her way to the cathedral with husband Prince Philip to reveal the figures, which have been created to mark her Diamond Jubilee. Scroll down for video . The statues of the Queen (left) and the Duke of Edinburgh (right) were unveiled at Canterbury Cathedral today . The statues were carved by sculptor Nina Bilbey, 47, from Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, and will stand by the west door in the Kent cathedral. The Dean of Canterbury, the Very Revd Dr Robert Willis, said: 'The new royal statues will be a splendid addition to the cathedral and they will be a sign of the high respect and affection that everyone at Canterbury has for the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.' She earlier opened visitor and education centre, The Wing, which offers an interactive experience of the story of the Battle of Britain. The building follows the wing plan of R J Mitchell's best-known fighter, the Supermarine Spitfire - one of the two aircraft credited with doing the most to win the battle in 1940. The Queen and The Duke were greeted by Prince Michael of Kent, who is a patron of the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydo. She then met with  some of the last surviving Battle of Britain pilots of Winston Churchill's famous 'few' at the National Memorial to the Few above the white cliffs in Kent. The statues were carved by sculptor Nina Bilbey, 47, from Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee . They are the first royal sculptures to be installed at the Kent Cathedral during her reign and it is her first visit to Canterbury in 13 years today . She has followed in the footsteps of her mother, the Queen Mother, who unveiled the memorial at Capel-le-Ferne, near Folkestone, on July 9, 1993. A flypast of a Hurricane, Spitfire and Typhoon took place over the English Channel where RAF pilots defied Germany's Luftwaffe more than 70 years ago. More than 500 of the 3,000 or so men of RAF Fighter Command died in the Battle of Britain between July and October 1940. Of the remainder, a further 814 died before the end of the war. As the battle raged in August 1940, Churchill uttered his famous words in a speech to Parliament: 'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.' Nina Bilbey, who was commissioned to carve the royal statues, stands proudly with the finished figures . Nina Bilbey, 47, is a sculptor and senior carving tutor at The City and Guilds Art School in London. She gained a B.A. Hons in Sculpture at St Martins School of Art before gaining a post graduate certificate in education from the University of Leeds. She has since done a diploma in stone masonry. Since 2000 Nina has specialised in stone carving and has been commissioned for several statues including ones for  Hampton Court flower show. She has also carved Gargoyles for St. Pancras Station and Saint Georges Chapel Windsor, and projects for The Houses of Parliament, The Royal Pavilion Brighton and Hereford Cathedral. The founder member of 'The London Carving Co-Op', Nina has spent six months working on the Royal Barge and has just finished a major carving commission for a Private house in Cheshire. She blogged about the royal commission on her website as she went along, showing the original sketches, the cast coloured in bronze powder and a half sized model version. Explaining how she made the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh statues, she said that it was very 'difficult getting the likeness and modelling tiny chains'. She said she spoke to Lady Hussey, one of the Queen's Lady in Waiting, who provided photographs and advised on how to do the hair. Pictures of the original designs were sent to the palace, which decided that the Prince should hold his robes, rather than gloves as she had planned.","The Queen arrived at Capel-Le-Ferne to open new £3.5million visitor centre .

83,"Manor team principal John Booth has assured critics the marque will be on track and competing in the next Formula One race in Malaysia later this month. Resurrected from Marussia's ashes and wrested from the clutches of administration by energy entrepreneur Stephen Fitzpatrick, a reborn Manor headed to Australia for the season-opening race at the weekend with every intention of taking to Melbourne's Albert Park circuit. Although the cars passed crash tests and wider scrutiny, Manor failed to emerge from the garage even once as they ran out of time in a bid to rebuild their IT infrastructure, lost after all hardware was wiped days before a planned auction of the team's assets. Manor team principal John Booth is confident his team will race in Malaysia later this month . Although the FIA cleared Manor of a potential breach of the rules as they were investigated for failing to fulfil obligations to compete, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone was left far from impressed. Ecclestone claims Manor had 'zero' intention of taking part and has threatened to charge them for all freight costs which are borne by Formula One Management for all teams for every race. Despite that, when asked by Press Association Sport on Saturday after the team had failed to take part in qualifying whether Ecclestone was being kept in the loop about their issues, Booth confirmed that was the case. Manor drivers Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi are expected to compete in Malaysia . 'Bernie just misses nothing, does he? He has been kept aware at every stage of the process,' replied Booth. As to whether Ecclestone was supportive, Booth nodded and said: 'Yep.' The suggestion from sceptics was Manor were in Australia simply to lay claim to the £28million owed to them by Ecclestone in prize money after back-to-back top-10 finishes in the constructors' championship. Booth, however, dismissed the notion as he said: 'We're entered in the Formula One World Championship and we felt it important to be present in Australia and try and compete. The Manor team work on their car in the garage in Australia . 'I can understand people being cynical, but if that was the case we wouldn't have brought 30 tonnes of equipment, 40 people, fulfilled our contracts with all suppliers - Pirelli, Ferrari, whoever - with our best endeavours to go round and round a circuit.' Booth claims another day of behind-the-scenes graft would likely have been enough for the team to turn a wheel, underlining his confidence that Malaysia will hold difficulties. Asked whether Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi will be on track in Sepang on March 27 for practice, Booth replied: 'Absolutely. 'We're in a massively different place now than where we were at the start of last week. 'The progress was colossal, just not quite enough, but now we'll get to Malaysia on Monday, start setting up at the circuit on Tuesday, and for sure we'll be ready to run on Friday.'

Barcelona have never won in three away trips to face PSG (L2 D1), including a 3-2 defeat in this year’ group stage.
PSG have lost one and drawn two of their three visits to the Nou Camp to face Barca, including a 3-1 defeat in this year’s group stage.

Atletico Madrid have scored exactly once in all four previous European meetings with city rivals Real, winning just once and losing three.
Including this season, there has been at least one Spanish team in the Champions League quarter-final for the last 10 campaigns.
For only the third time in European Cup history, a quarter-final tie will feature two Spanish sides; however it is the second season in a row that this has happened (Real Madrid v Sevilla in 1958 and Atletico v Barcelona in 2014).
Bayern only lost 1 of 22 competitive matches versus Portuguese teams (13 W, 8 D): the European Cup final 1987: 1-2 versus Porto.

86,"New York cops gave two teens jaywalking tickets as they were being treated in an emergency room, suffering multiple injuries, after being struck by a vehicle in Brooklyn. Beanca Moise and Jo-Anna Thiboutot, both 16, were rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center on March 14 suffering multiple fractures and bruises after being struck by a car as they attempted to cross the street mid-block in a section of Flatbush Avenue, according to the New York Post. Moise said she thought the cops standing near her hospital bed, as doctors swarmed around her, were there to see if she was okay. Tickets: New York cops gave Beanca Moise (photographed) and Jo-Anna Thiboutot jaywalking tickets as they were being treated in an emergency room, suffering multiple injuries, after being struck by a vehicle in Brooklyn . Instead, they were there to give her and Thiboutot tickets for jaywalking -- illegally or recklessly crossing the street without regard for approaching traffic. 'It was very insulting,' Moise told the Post. 'I got hit by a car, and they came to the hospital not even checking if I was okay, and just gave us the ticket.' The cops told the Post that they were simply following Mayor Bill de Blasio's Vision Zero orders - an effort to end traffic deaths and injuries by cracking down on reckless drivers and pedestrians. They told the teens' parents that the tickets were mandatory given the mayor's 'zero tolerance' jaywalking policy. Mandatory: The cops told Moise's (photographed) and Thiboutot's parents that the tickets were mandatory given Mayor Bill de Blasio's 'zero tolerance' jaywalking policy . Thiboutot's mother, Rose Benjamin, was handed the teen's summons as her daughter was being treated for deep bruises and gashes on a hospital stretcher. The accident reports and the girls' summonses blame the teens for running into traffic because the girls were attempting to cross the street mid-block, the Post reports. Each summons was signed by one 63rd Precinct cop, a 'PO Nagle.' The driver, Edwin Lawrence, did not receive a summons because a witness reportedly told police Lawrence had the right of way. Jaywalking summonses have risen to 2,000 a year since the mayor implemented the crackdown, according to the Post. The cops told the Post that they were simply following Mayor de Blasio's (center) Vision Zero orders - an effort to end traffic deaths and injuries by cracking down on reckless drivers and pedestrians . 'Crackdown:' Wiley Norvell, a spokesperson for City Hall, took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown' The girls' families plan to fight the summons and sue the driver. They hired lawyer Michael Goldberg who questioned why the officers had to hand-deliver the tickets to the girls while they were being treated at the hospital, the Post reports. Weeks after the incident, Moise remains on crutches and reportedly needs two more months to recover from fractures and bone contusions. Though the officer's held that they were simply following orders in delivering the 'mandatory' tickets, Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for City Hall, told Gothamist that there is 'no such thing as a 'zero tolerance' policy on jaywalking.' 'Enforcement decisions are made precinct by precinct as commanding officers see fit, based on conditions they see on the ground,' he said. Serious Injuries: In 2014, an elderly man, Kang Wong, suffered serious head injures as NYPD cops attempted to arrest him after stopping the man for jaywalking in the city's Upper West Side . Norvell stated that five jaywalking tickets are issued each day adding that 100 are given for failure to yield. Norvell took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown.' The city saw an increase in jaywalking tickets shortly after the mayor implemented the Vision Zero plan in 2014. With Police Commissioner Bill Bratton embracing the mayor's plan, the New York Police Department issued more than 400 jaywalking tickets in the first two months of 2014 -- compared with just 50 the year before, the Post reports. The jaywalking 'crackdown' provided tickets to many New Yorkers last year, Meanwhile de Blasio and his security detail were caught on video jaywalking.

'When you go out in the wet for the first time it is all about adapting to new conditions.

I think the pace looks decent but we have to be realistic that Mercedes still have an advantage. We just have to look after ourselves.' Rosberg conceded he simply 'didn't drive well enough'. He added: 'I'm annoyed by that, third place is not good enough. 'For tomorrow, I'm on the clean side of the grid so that should help me pass Seb at the start.' Vettel's P2 finish for Ferrari ended Mercedes' run of nine straight front-row lockouts . Rosberg was annoyed by his P3 finish and simply admitted he was not good enough . Hamilton set the fastest time with his first lap of the final session, skipping around adroitly on intermediate tyres. His calm performance followed the delay caused when rain started to fall two minutes into the second session. It was soon bouncing ankle high off the Sepang track. The cars, which had lined up at the end of the pit straight to get on the track to set a time before the rain started, tiptoed back to the garage. The times already set stood: Hamilton was only eighth fastest. His Mercedes team-mate Rosberg was fastest. ‘You guys got me too far behind everyone, man,’ Hamilton radioed back to his team about not getting to the front of the queue. But he had at least scraped through into the final session of qualifying, where he was to show his class in wet conditions. Daniel Ricciardo will join Rosberg on the second row in Malaysia in his Red Bull . Toro Rosso teenager Max Verstappen qualified for Sunday's race in sixth position . Vettel’s team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, who was impeded on the busy track as he tried to set a fast lap, was eliminated early. He will start 11th. Race officials called a hiatus of at least 15 minutes. The drivers got out of their car. Fans had already run for cover from the exposed green banks. A restart was then planned for 6.15pm local time – a quarter of an hour after the scheduled end of the session with daylight beginning to fade. The McLarens were out of the reckoning even before the rain started. Jenson Button had one-tenth of an advantage over his team-mate Fernando Alonso, but they were both eliminated in the first session. Kimi Raikkonen will start 11th on the grid after being eliminated in the second qualifying session . Dark clouds gather in the background at the Sepang International Circuit during the qualifying session . ‘I can’t get the tyres working,’ said Button, who will start 17th. An optimistic Button told Sky Sports: 'When you get out of the car and you are 17th on the grid you're disappointed. But we've got to look at our progress and it is a lot of progress. We have made massive steps with the engine and are more competitive on the long run. It's still going to be tough tomorrow but we're making progress. Alonso added: 'It is a tough period at the moment for us but the facts and numbers are much better than Australia in terms of pace and we are making progress. Every race we will improve and we will learn things.' Fernando Alonso returned to action in Malaysia following his crash in pre-season testing . Jenson Button will start 17th on the grid after being eliminated in the first qualifying session . Alonso also struggled in the McLaren and will begin the race on Sunday in 18th place on the grid . Only the manor cars were below the McLarens on the timing sheets. Roberto Merhi was seven seconds off the pace while his team-mate Will Stevens did not even put in a lap. A fuel pressure problem was to blame, the latest in a catalogue of problems for the team. Stevens however, will line up at the back of the grid after Manor applied successfully to the stewards to let him race  on the grounds he ‘set satisfactory times in practice’. They failed even to get on to the track in Melbourne a fortnight ago and will have only Merhi representing them in the race here. Their part-participation in Formula One is in danger of turning into a prolonged embarrassment.","Lewis Hamilton on pole for Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix .

88,"(CNN)For years, Native Americans have called on Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change the team's name. It's a dictionary-defined racial slur that's dehumanizing to Native Americans. And, in my view, that outweighs the arguments of Redskins advocates who defend the name as a symbol of team pride. But what about the thousands of high schools across the United States that have the name as its mascot? Where do they fit in the debate? Once you factor in freedom of speech, how should one approach this issue? Recently, in upstate New York, the Lancaster Central District School Board unanimously voted to retire its high school's mascot and moniker -- the ""Redskins."" The board called the mascot ""a symbol of ethnic stereotyping"" and said the school ""cannot continue practices which are offensive and hurtful to others"" -- namely Native Americans. Some students opposed the board's decision citing school legacy and tradition. A group of Lancaster High students hosted a walk out in protest with many carrying placards reading, ""Redskins Pride"" and ""Once a Redskin, Always a Redskin."" Coincidentally, around the same time in Delaware, the Conrad Schools of Science announced it will begin to take steps to drop its ""Redskins"" mascot before the beginning of the 2015-16 school year. Local school districts are responding to the growing chorus of voices who oppose antiquated Native American mascots. Furthermore, there's research that shows Indian mascots and monikers harm the mental health of Native American youths. According to one study, Native American students are reported to have low self-esteem and a suppressed sense of self-worth as a consequence of such images and language. Other research shows how all ethnic groups are hurt by poor representations of Native Americans. People ""are more likely to negatively stereotype other ethnic groups as well,"" according to Wendy Quinton, clinical assistant professor of psychology at the University at Buffalo. What the Conrad Schools of Science and the Lancaster school board decisions represent for Native Americans are hope -- for us and our kids -- that broader awareness is changing perspectives and that hurtful stereotypical nicknames should not have to be tolerated by any ethnic group. Still, there's the issue of free speech. Many have made the argument that Native Americans like me are trampling on the First Amendment when we call for the Washington football team to change its name. Even the ACLU has chimed in on the matter. On March 6, the organization said in a blog it does not support the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's decision to cancel federal trademark protection of the Washington football team's use of the word ""redskins."" In June of last year, the USPTO had repealed six of the team's seven trademarks, finding the r-word is ""disparaging to Native Americans."" Although the ACLU agrees the team name is ""offensive and perpetuates racism against Native Americans,"" it cannot support what it refers to as language policing. ""... Because the First Amendment protects against government interference in private speech,"" staff attorney Esha Bhandari wrote. ""It isn't government's role to pick and choose which viewpoints are acceptable and which are not."" Here's the thing, folks -- no one has a First Amendment right to federal trademark protection. Tara Houska, a tribal rights attorney in Washington, said, ""Freedom of speech is a fundamental right. In contrast, federal trademark protection is a privilege that one applies for at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office."" I think the ACLU is confusing rights with privileges. The U.S. government isn't telling the Washington football team it can't use the word. According to the USPTO, Snyder and his ilk can keep using the team name -- he just won't have federal trademark protection. Last month, Democratic Rep. Mike Honda of California filed a bill that would ban existing and future teams that use the word from receiving federal trademark protection. He told me he's ""disappointed"" that the ACLU would defend the Washington team, which he refers to as ""a multi-billion dollar company profiting off a racial slur."" ""The First Amendment is not the issue here -- no one, including the football team, would be prohibited from using the name,"" he wrote in an email. ""The team would only lose their exclusive rights to it."" And in the case of Lancaster High Schools, the government didn't step in -- the decision to retire the name was made by conscientious objectors in the community. Let's look at the issue from another angle. What do we do as responsible adults when we learn a habit or tradition is adversely affecting our children? We do everything we can to fix the problem. What we do not do is make excuses so we can continue the terrible habit. As the late Maya Angelou so aptly put it, ""Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better."" America needs to do better as a whole with regard to Native Americans. This isn't just about Indian mascots. This isn't just about offensive racial slurs. This is about the dehumanization of Native Americans. And if history has shown us anything, it's that when one group dehumanizes another, bad things happen. Honda's bill, the USPTO's repeal and the Lancaster school board's decision are not examples of anti-free speech madness. They are acting like responsible adults in defense of children who are at risk. And as for me, I'll protect children first before I protect anyone's right to harm them.","Recently, schools are deciding to retire the term 'redskins' for their mascots .

90,"An Ohio family with a three-year-old daughter who has up to 1,000 seizures a day has moved 1,200 miles to Colorado in hopes of getting treatment in the form of medical marijuana. Addyson Benton, of Liberty Township, was diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy at nine months old, which have delayed her communication and motor-skill growth. And though she's tried at least ten anti-seizure drugs, nothing seems to reduce her symptoms. Her parents, Heather and Adam Benton, researched a form of non-psychoactive medical marijuana that is illegal in Ohio, and decided it's in Addyson's best interest to give the drug a try. Young: Addyson Benton, of Liberty Township, Ohio, was diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy at nine months old and has tried ten anti-seizure drugs with no result . Epilepsy: When Addyson (pictured here with her mom, Heather Benton) was diagnosed she was having up to 1,000 seizures per day . Development: The three-year-old girl (pictured here with her father, Adam Benton) has had delayed communication and motor-skills growth because of her seizures . The family already has two doctors in Colorado that Addyson sees once a year and both told the family that THCa would be beneficial, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. They intended to move in October 2014 but decided to stay in Ohio after being told they were on a waiting list for cannabidiol oil that would be shipped to them from Colorado. After being told that the oil - called Charlotte's Web CBD oil after halting seizures in a girl named Charlotte Fiji - shipped to them until the  October 2015, they decided to finally make the move. The family  had a chance to try the oil, which is usually taken orally through a syringe or an empty pill capsule, on Addyson before moving and said they can already see improvements in two weeks. Medication: Addyson's parents researched a non-psychoactive form of medical marijuana that they believe will help their daughter. Her two doctors in Colorado, who she sees once a year, also believe she will benefit from the drug . Big move: Addyson's family is moving 1,200 miles from Liberty Township, Ohio, to Castle Rock, Colorado, in hopes of helping stop their daughter's epilepsy . 'Her walking is better, her talking is better, her attention is better. It's phenomenal the changes we have seen in her these two weeks, but it has not controlled her seizures,' Heather Benton told the Enquirer. 'We really need to jump on top of that while she's growing.' Once the family reaches Colorado, her treatments will cost about $300 per month. Their move to Castle Rock, Colorado, comes after two years of planning, and Adam Benton secured a job in the state before leaving home. Trial run: Addyson was able to try the CBD oil two weeks before she left Ohio, and her family said they can already see improvements . Expensive: The family has been planning their move off-and-on for about two years. Once they reach their new home, Addyson's treatments will cost about $300 per month . Organizations are trying to get the legalization of marijuana on the Ohio ballot for November, but the Bentons said that Addyson needs help now. 'We need to get out to Colorado and come up with a plan and figure out what things are going to work for her. Once we figure that out, and Ohio's bill passes we can look at getting her on the same medication and then we can come back,' Heather Benton said. She added: 'Even if the bill passed tomorrow, if I went to my neurologist or our pediatrician, they wouldn't have a clue what to tell us about dosing and what's safe with her current medications. 'We just want to be surrounded by people who know what they are doing.' Visit the Benton family's GoFundMe page to donate toward Addyson's treatment. New bill: Though organizations in Ohio are trying to get the legalization of marijuana on the ballot for November, the Bentons said Addyson needs help now . Hope: Heather and Adam Benton's goal is that the move will help them find doctors 'who know what they are doing' and that Addyson's seizures can be reduced .","Addyson Benton, of  Ohio, was diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy at nine months old and has tried ten anti-seizure drugs with no result .

91,"Millwall have dismissed manager Ian Holloway and installed club legend Neil Harris as they attempt to try and avoid relegation from The Championship. Chairman John Berylson and the board are believed to have lost patience with Holloway following Saturday's 4-1 home defeat against Norwich City and a decision was announced on Tuesday morning. Harris scored a club record 138 goals in 432 appearances for The Lions and currently works at The New Den coaching their elite development squad. Ian Holloway scratches his head, but time has run out for him to find the solutions to Millwall's problems . Jonathan Howson scored for Norwich during their 4-1 win over Millwall, the club's fourth straight defeat . He served as caretaker-manager last season after Millwall sacked Steve Lomas before appointing Holloway. The dismissal of Holloway is a devastating blow to one of football's most colourful and quotable managers. Known throughout the game as 'Olly', he helped Blackpool win promotion to the Premier League where they were only relegated on the final day with a defeat at Manchester United. Neil Harris, currently the elite development squad coach at Millwall, has been caretaker-manager before . Harris is a legend at Millwall, having scored over 100 times for the club as a player . Holloway fails to get his message across to his players in another defeat for the Championship strugglers . But since leaving Broomfield Road, Holloway was sacked by Crystal Palace and things haven't gone well at Millwall this season.

92,"Diego Maradona appears to have patched things up with his 24-year-old girlfriend as the pair were spotted strolling through Vienna on Saturday just months after he allegedly hit her. The scruffily-attired ex-footballer was seen walking arm-in-arm with on-off partner Rocio Oliva, with the blonde pictured leaning on his shoulder affectionately. Just five months ago, he was labelled a 'psychopath' after video footage emerged which appeared to show him assaulting Ms Oliva. Scroll down for video . Forgive and forget: Maradona and his on-off girlfriend Rocio Oliva, 24, were pictured strolling through Vienna on Saturday just months after she filmed him allegedly assaulting her . In the video, Maradona, who captained Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 before managing the side with less success, can be seen getting up from his sofa and approaching his Ms Oliva to berate her for using her mobile phone. Oliva filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone?' She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. Following the video's release, the former footballer played down the incident insisting he had only knocked the phone out of her hands. Scruffy attire: The 54-year-old ex-footballer looked less than smart as he walked through the Austrian capital . Backing royal: Maradona and Miss Oliva were in Vienna to meet Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein (left), who they are backing to become the next president of Fifa . He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there.' Two weeks later the couple appeared to be in better spirits as Maradona was filmed serenading Ms Oliva with an impromptu love song in Dubai. Maradona, whose notorious Hand of God goal helped Argentina knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, has been dating Ms Oliva on and off since the beginning of 2013. Also with the pair in Vienna on Saturday was Jordanian royal Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, who Maradona is backing to become the next president of Fifa. He is convinced the Jordanian deserves to win the presidency and says he will not be an 'advocate for corruption', suggesting he does not want current president Sepp Blatter to win another term. Happy couple: Maradona and Ms Oliva, pictured with Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, appear to have put their troubles behind them .

93,"Obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime . Obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime, according to research. These weight-related cancers include bowel, post-menopausal breast, gallbladder, womb, kidney, pancreatic and oesophageal types. Statistics released by Cancer Research UK show that obese women have around a one in four risk of developing a cancer linked to weight in their lifetime. In a group of 1,000 obese women, 274 will be diagnosed with a bodyweight-linked cancer in their lifetime, compared with 194 women diagnosed in a group of 1,000 healthy weight women. Approximately a quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year. There are different ways that obesity could increase the risk of cancer. One possibility is that it is linked to the production of hormones by fat cells – especially oestrogen which is thought to fuel the disease. Around 12 per cent of postmenopausal breast cancers – a total of 5,269 women – are blamed on obesity. It is the highest number of cases linked to obesity because the cancer is so common. Last year a study found women were at double the risk of getting the disease because of their weight compared with men. Researchers said 8.2 per cent of all cancers in women in the UK were caused by being fat. The study found 4.4 per cent of all cancers in men were due to obesity. Previous estimates claimed if Britons continue to pile on the pounds, it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026. Dr Julie Sharp of Cancer Research UK said: 'Losing weight isn't easy, but you don't have to join a gym and run miles every day or give up your favourite food. Just making small changes that you can maintain in the long term can have a real impact. To get started, try getting off the bus a stop earlier and cutting down on fatty and sugary foods. A quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year . 'Gradually build on these to achieve a healthier lifestyle that you can maintain. And find out about local services, which can provide help and support to make lifestyle changes. We know that our cancer risk depends on a combination of our genes, our environment and other aspects of our lives, many of which we can control – helping people understand how they can reduce their risk of developing cancer in the first place remains crucial in tackling the disease. 'Lifestyle changes – like not smoking, keeping a healthy weight, and cutting back on alcohol – are the big opportunities for us all to reduce our cancer risk. Making these changes is not a guarantee against cancer, but it stacks the odds in our favour.' Breast cancer patients can raise their chances of survival by exercising, a study has found. Tumours grew more slowly when mice being treated for cancer had an exercise wheel in their cage. It means that in future, breast cancer patients could be prescribed exercise as part of their treatment. As cancers grow, the blood vessels supplying them with oxygen become thin and tangled, making it harder for drugs to reach the tumour. But when US researchers from the Duke Cancer Institute in North Carolina let mice with breast cancer run on wheels, their bloody supply improved. Researcher Dr Mark Dewhirst said: 'We were truly amazed by these findings.' Macmillan Cancer Support has previously described exercise as a 'wonder drug'.","Obese women have a 40%  higher risk of developing seven cancers .

Locals may not have any waves to catch, but they have managed to quench their thirst for surfing with an unorthodox daredevil-friendly pastime.

96,"The only word I can use to describe my feeling over the last few days is distraught, really. The night we lost to Bangladesh I found myself staring at the floor in disbelief and I was trying to work out in my own mind what happened. Then over the next couple of days it started to sink in and the disappointment turned to anger. Anger at ourselves. It was in our hands and the players have to take every bit of heat we get because we were in a very winnable position in that game. We just didn’t take to the pressure well at all. What went wrong? It’s tricky as players to try to offer an explanation because it can sound like an excuse. But I will try. Did we lack a bit of experience? You look at the big teams here at this World Cup and most of the players have played a lot more one-day internationals than us. There’s always a temptation to call for change at times like this but my gut feeling would be to keep this group of players together to get them that experience over the next four years before the next World Cup. We don’t play as much one-day and Twenty20 cricket as others because of our schedules but we have to find a way to be honest so we can get that experience. You learn how to win games in tricky positions and the pressure of winning a game for England is completely different to doing it for your county. Stuart Broad (bottom) lays on the floor during England's World Cup Pool A defeat to Bangladesh on Monday . Don’t blame the coach . It’s unfair to pin the blame on Peter Moores. We’ve worked a lot on our game and the coach can’t do anything about the players not being able to take the heat of the battle when it most matters. Coaches try to teach that but you only really get it by winning and losing at the highest level. I’m reading a book called The Unstoppable Golfer by Bob Rotella and a lot of what he says applies to cricket. It’s about players taking responsibility to get into a position to handle the pressure. There was no reason why we couldn’t have beaten Bangladesh on that flat wicket at the Adelaide Oval. No reason why we shouldn’t have been able to chase 275. England coach Peter Moores (left) has come under strong criticism for their early World Cup exit . Below my best . It’s stating the obvious to say I haven’t taken the amount of wickets I would have liked in this tournament but it’s never the definitive way to judge how you have bowled. I like to judge myself on the processes, whether I’ve hit the right areas and whether I’ve created chances. I feel like I have created chances but I’ve not hit the right areas as consistently as I’d like to have done. At the start of the tournament I tried to bowl as quickly as I could but found I wasn’t moving the ball as much as I’d like. So against Bangladesh I changed that and tried to bowl a bit more as if it was a Test and looked for movement. That was better but it took me too long to figure it out in these conditions. I’ve not been happy with myself but it’s such a shame it’s been cut short because there’s a lot of cricket left in this tournament. This group had a lot more expectation than we’ve shown but hopefully a lot of them will be around to grow over the next couple of years. Broad admits he hasn't been happy with his productivity levels in terms of taking wickets at the World Cup . The obsession with statistics . I really don’t know where that has come from. It’s completely wrong to say we are obsessed with statistics or over-analyse things. In my eight or nine years of England touring this trip has seen fewer meetings than ever before. There’s also been the least number of stats flying around. If you are winning then people say you are fantastically prepared if you have good analysis but if you’re losing it becomes something to take aim at. If you want information on your game or an opponent’s then it’s available to you but we haven’t had anything thrown at us. The fast bowler adds that despite talk of stats there have been fewer team meetings than ever before . Moving on . It’s still very raw going out of this World Cup at this stage and that frustration and anger is still there. I’m disappointed with how I played and I’m sure all the guys feel the same. It’s natural and if those feelings weren’t there you would have to ask questions. I feel embarrassed to be honest. Another book I read recently was Roy Keane’s and he’d say that if Manchester United lost on a Saturday when he played he’d be embarrassed to leave his home on a Sunday. That’s how I’m feeling right now but games and challenges come round so quickly that you have to pick yourself up as soon as you can. We can’t afford to sulk. Broad says England can't afford to sulk on their World Cup disappointment with a busy fixture list ahead . A one-day future . I’m only 28 and I want to continue playing one-day cricket for England. Look at the best teams here and they all have experience in their teams. I’ve not shown enough quality in this tournament but the next World Cup is in England and my record is good at home. You can’t say what’s going to happen in the next four years but I’d certainly like to play a key role leading up to the next one. They say a bowler’s peak is from 28 to 33 so why wouldn’t I want to play? I know we are the only team who plays all-year round and that means a lot of cricket but I try to give myself the best opportunity I can to play for England as often as I can. I rest where possible and I haven’t been to the Indian Premier League. That’s because I want to play for England and I want to keep on doing that in all forms. At 28, Broad (right) aims to play in the next World Cup for England which will be on home soil . A modern approach . We’ve got the players to produce the modern brand of cricket we are seeing in one-day cricket, of course we have. Look at people like Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali and Joe Root. It’s just that we haven’t delivered it here. Those guys will have a significant number of one-day caps when they play in the next World Cup and that will give them more expertise and more confidence. We must make sure that we accept it if guys like those get out at times playing the modern way and someone like Mo can definitely bat as fluently at the top of the order as some of the players we have seen at this tournament. He just has to be backed to do so. I think the right 15 players were in this World Cup squad and we can only look at ourselves as to why we haven’t justified the faith placed in us. It will take a long time to get over what’s happened here it is what it is and if we don’t learn from it that will be criminal.

98,"Do I welcome the news that Next is about to overtake M&S? Sales at Next grew 7.2 per cent last year, to £4 billion, while it’s predicted that clothing sales at Marks & Spencer will have drooped like so many Per Una gypsy skirts when figures are announced later this week. They will also be about £4 billion. I loved Next, the brainchild of George Davies, when it launched in 1982. It was the first brand to give us affordable luxury, with its very first campaign giving us chunky 100 per cent wool knits, soft chambray, and very British tweed. It gave us the revolutionary Next Directory in 1988, a classy precursor to online shopping, and of course in 1998 pioneered selling fashion online, becoming the largest ‘etailer’ in Europe. Scroll down for video . The smart outfit: Next's foil pleated skirt and blush formal jacket (left) wins for being conventional over Marks and Spencer's double breasted Crêpe Drape coat (right) deemed too strange for a wedding . Now, though, I find its success troubling: it survives and conquers through bargain-basement prices, undercutting Marks by scrimping on quality. A real leather weekend tote in the very first Next Directory cost £99; today a similar version is £72. In 1988 a wool blazer was £60; today a synthetic version is £34. And it flourishes, of course, by offering young women instant credit: I must point out its interest fees are ferocious – as is its hounding of late payers. To achieve these startling new figures, Next has abandoned what it once did really well – classy tailored minimalism for the office – and now chases catwalk trends. But it has always thought on its flatform-shod feet, while M&S seems to lumber, and is offering quality, yes, but at prices women now habituated to cheap fashion baulk at. (Remember the recent £345 all-wool winter coat?) After comparing the two giants’ ranges here, I think it’s time Marks’s style director Belinda Earl went five days a week from her current three, don’t you? The smart outfit for a wedding... or for work . NEXT: Foil pleated skirt; £45 Blush formal jacket, £34 . This accordion pleated midi skirt is a couple of years too late, but I love it, and I love, too, the soft pink jacket. It’s very Rick Owens: long, lean and slim fitting. The outfit only works on the slim – pleats are never good on the wide of berth. M&S: M&S Collection double breasted Crêpe Drape coat, £65; Cut-out rear panelled skater dress, £45 . A trench may seem strange for a smart wedding, but it could work with a hot coloured dress poking out below. Sling it over your shoulders for work. And the winner is... Next wins for being truly conventional, which is what women want for work or a formal occasion – but do beware the midi length, which can be frumpy: you will need to make sure the rest of you is sleek, with killer heels, not flats. The 'casual gypsy' look . Casual gypsy: Next steals the win by a whisker with an ochre crochet trim top (left) over M&S's fringed kimono . NEXT: Ochre crochet trim top, £28; flared jeans, £20 . The jeans are almost identical to M&S’s, but crucially cheaper. The top will have people asking when the baby’s due, but at least shows some flesh. M&S: Limited Edition fringed Kimono jacket, £39.50; flared jeans, £29.50; vest, £9.50 . The jeans are nice and inky, but quite narrow for flares, while the gypsy top is just awful: it swamps the wearer. And the winner is... Next by a whisker. The summer dresses . Summer dresses: Marks and Spencer's Per Una Lace Shift dress (right) wins hands down over Next's sack-like printed folk dress (left) NEXT: Paisley print folk dress, £30 . A little bit sack-like, but I can see this with a tan and gladiator sandals being worn on holiday by the young and leggy. M&S: Per Una Lace Shift Dress, £75 . This dress is lovely: a very current, sub-Erdem print, a scalloped hem that softens the knee area, and a bit of a sleeve, which is what women told Marks and Spencer’s style director Belinda Earl they want – plus it’s easily smart enough for a wedding. And the winner is... M&S wins hands down: it has a sexy shape, but is forgiving, too. The suede persuasion . Suede persuasion: M&S win by a country mile with the Autograph Suede Skirt (right) while Next's effort (left) completely missed the boat on the trend . NEXT: Suedette Tassel Jacket, £55 Dark denim flared jeans, £20 . Next completely missed the boat on this trend: all they have in suede is this jacket with tassels, just £55 as it’s faux. M&S: Autograph Suede Skirt, £199; Autograph knitted jumper, £35 . When Alexa Chung was photographed in this very now Autograph suede skirt last week, the M&S website started smoking, even though it won’t hit stores until April 10. Suede and leather always do well for M&S and this will shoot off the rails: it’s not mumsy, and feels luxurious. Younger women will opt for the shorter, £75 version at Topshop. And the winner is... M&S, by a country mile: real skin at Next would be prohibitively expensive, so in a way it’s great they don’t even try. The funkiest of the accessories . Funky accessories: Next takes the win by a nose with accessories including a fringe rucksack and flatforms (left) over M&S's faux leather cross body bag and sling backs (right) NEXT: Denim flatforms, £35; Suede fringed rucksack, £62 (Flared jeans, £28; Blush utility jacket, £55) Much funkier than M&S, Next has done lots of small, neat saddle bags, too, which were all over the catwalk. M&S: Limited Edition faux leather cross body bag, £35; Autograph sling backs, £45 (Per Una white jeans, £39.50, Autograph knitted jumper, £35) A huge improvement on last summer. The cross body bag is a good size, and faux is infinitely better than cheap nasty leather. The sling backs are very Kate Middleton. And the winner is... Next by a nose.","Sales at Next grew 7.2 per cent last year while it’s predicted Marks & Spencer's clothing sales will have dropped .

Having finally agreed terms to clash in Las Vegas on May 2, the rivals will hold just one press conference, in downtown Los Angeles on March 11. Both men began their official training camps on Monday; Mayweather at his gym in Las Vegas and Pacquiao at Freddie Roach's Wild Card in Los Angeles. Manny Pacquiao trained in the Philippines before jetting to Los Angeles to continue his preparations . Pacquiao watched his basketball team lose on Sunday before flying to Los Angeles to start his camp . The Filipino star posted a video of himself jogging after he had flown in from his homeland over the weekend. Pacquiao must do without legendary trainer Roach until next week as the 54-year-old is preparing for Zou Shiming's first world title fight  against Amnat Ruenroeng in Macao on Saturday. But when he returns, Roach will shut down his gym to work on the game plan he has devised. 'I won't tell you what the game plan is because that will be very silent,' he told the South China Morning Post. 'The whole Wildcard Gym [in Los Angeles, where Pacquiao is training] will be shut down and we will work out Manny's best strategy and nobody will watch it.' Mayweather will work with his father and uncle and has already booked the services of former opponent DeMarcus Corley as a sparring partner, according to Fight Hype. Corley troubled Mayweather in their 2004 fight but was knocked down twice before losing a unanimous decision. Mayweather and Pacquiao had not met before they went to the same basketball match in Miami earlier this year.

100,"Helplessly stuck in a patch of mud, this tiny zebra foal appeared doomed to a prolonged and agonising death. Then along came the most unlikely of rescuers - a gigantic bull rhino who had been attracted by the creature's desperate struggles and mewling cries. It was the work of a moment for the enormous animal to hoist the foal out of the mud and to safety. But tragically this was one rescue that did not have a happy ending. Oblivious to its own strength, the rhino ended up impaling the zebra on its horn. Scroll down for video . Stuck in the mud: A bull rhino spots a zebra foal stuck in mud near a watering hole at the Madikwe Game Reserve and decides to start prodding the hapless youngster with his horn . Up you come: After a few seconds prodding the foal, the bull decides to hook it with his horn and yank it from the sticky morass - a move which seems to have come too quickly for the weakened youngster . Brutal: Although now free, the foal is almost sent flying by the bull rhino's sudden movement . Tragic: The young zebra slumps heavily down onto the rhino's horn. It is not clear whether this is the point that the foal was disembowelled by the bull's clumsy rescue . Roel van Muiden, a field guide and wildlife photographer, spotted the foal stuck in a deep and pitiless patch of mud while he was showing visitors around the Madikwe Game Reserve in South Africa. Nearby a bull rhino was chasing some females, then being chased away in return, but the foal's mother and her herd were nowhere to be seen. 'The foal must have been there for quite some time,' wrote Mr van Muiden in Africa Geographic. The bull rhino, he went on, finally gave up on his futile advances. Wandering down to the water, he found the hapless foal. Curious, the huge beast began prodding the youngster with his horn. After a while the bull, growing impatient with his toy, sank his snout deep into the mire before quickly lifting the foal from the mud. This was no altruistic rescue mission, having helped it escape the morass he merely dropped the animal and wandered off. But then he came back to the exhausted youngster for another look. Apparently wanting to see the foal from another angle, he used his horn to move it into a different position, and disembowelled it. Dropping it again, the bull flopped to the mud himself for a roll-around, almost crushing the dying baby zebra. The stricken animal didn't last much longer. Boredom: The bull rhino had earlier got nowhere with his advances towards a couple of nearby cows . Mr van Muisen said many things went through his mind as he watched the tragedy unfold, but his foremost thought was to 'let nature be nature'. 'I have had many comments from people seeing the photos asking why I did not retrieve the foal from the mud,' he said. 'The zebra’s herd was gone so even if I could have, he would not have survived as his mother and harem were nowhere to be seen and thus he would have died from starvation.' Mr van Muisen added that the foal's mother probably knew her child was caught in a hopeless situation. She probably had good reason for abandoning it to its fate, he said. Despite the foal's sad and early end, he said he felt lucky to see what he described as 'an amazing interaction between two species.' 'I have been guiding for almost ten years and may go on for many and still never witness something as amazing and melancholy as this.'","South African Roel van Muiden saw the incident at Madike Game Reserve .

101,"She was the fastest vessel in the world's oceans and it seems the RMS Mauretania is still making waves - as a 12ft long model of the ship is set to sell for £50,000. The beautifully-crafted 1:64 scale model of the luxury British liner  was made to celebrate the actual ship's launch in 1906. The model will be auctioned in May - 100 years after Mauretania's ill-fated sister ship Lusitania was sunk by a German U-boat killing 1,198 passengers and crew. Scroll down for video . Set for auction: A beautifully crafted 100-year-old model of the RMS Mauretania is expected to fetch £50,000 at auction when sold in May . The actual ship: The vessel, once the fastest in the world, is seen in a photo taken from its sister ship RMS Lusitania before the First World War . RMS Mauretania held the record for the fastest Transatlantic voyage for 22 years until 1929, making it the world's fastest ship for almost a quarter of a century. She was built in 1906 after the cruise-liner company Cunard won a £2million loan from the Government to construct two vessels. RMS Mauretania made her maiden voyage the following year, setting off from Liverpool for New York on November 16, 1907. Weighing 31,938 tons, the ship had enough space for 563 1st class passengers, 464 in 2nd class and 1,138 in 3rd class. In 1909, just two years after its maiden voyage, RMS Mauretania obtained the Blue Riband title for the fastest eastbound and westbound journeys across the Atlantic. It held the title for 22 years until 1929 when it was surpassed by the German liner Bremen. As part of Cunard's original deal with the Government, the ship was made available to the Armed Forces during times of national emergency. So on August 4 1914 when Britain declared war on Germany, it was redirected from its path to New York and docked at Halifax to be named an armed cruise liner. The following week however the Mauretania and the Lusitania, its sister ship, were relieved of Government duties. She was docked at Liverpool with dwindling demand for transatlantic passages during the war until May 2015 when the Lusitania was sunk by Nazi torpedoes. Returned to service, the Mauretania was used to transport troops during the Gallipoli Campaign before being turned into a hospital ship. Later she was used to transport Canadian troops to France before being laid up on the Clyde until 1918. She resumed commercial passages in 1919, sailing from Southampton to New York via Cherbourg and in 1922 broke its pre-war transatlantic record for the fastest crossing, her average speed above 26 knots. In 1934 she made her final passenger voyage before being laid up in Glasgow following the merger of Cunard and White Star Lines. Now outdated and with the companies' required to reduce their fleet, she was sold for scrap the following year. The wooden replica was loaned by Swan Hunter, the company that built both ships for cruise line firm Cunard, to the Science Museum in London in 1938. The institution displayed it in their Shipping Gallery which was closed in 2012 and the model was removed and put into storage. It is still owned by Newcastle-based Swan Hunter but the company have decided to sell it. The model, which is 17in wide, 42in tall and weighs half a tonne, will be sold in London on May 12. London-based auctioneer Charles Miller said: 'The model is extremely decorative and detailed. It is one of the most glamorous models you will see. 'We are expecting interest from private collectors and museums in this. You can imagine it would make a great conversation piece in someone's home.' Cunard commissioned Swan Hunter to build the Lusitania and the Mauretania in response to the increasing threat of its domination of the Transatlantic passenger trade posed by the White Star Line, which went on to build the Titanic. The Mauretania held the prestigious Blue Riband title for the fastest Transatlantic voyage for 22 years until it was beaten 1929 by the German liner Bremen. A scale model of the Lusitania was also made but after the ship was torpedoed with the loss of 1,198 passengers in 1915 it was turned into a second miniature version of the Mauritania as it was thought it could have brought bad luck. That model still exists and its last known location was on board the QEII. The boat and model were both built by Swan Hunter, and the model was lent to London's Science Museum in 1938, where it stayed until 2012 . The 1:64 scale model of the ship was built by the Swan Hunter to commemorate ithe launch of the RMS Mauretania- which went on to break the record for the fastest sail across the Atlantic .

102,"Liverpool are the biggest English club  when measured solely by the number of major trophies won, all-time. With 18 league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, five European Cups and three UEFA Cups, they have lifted 41 major honours in their history, two more than their closest rivals in this regard, Manchester United, who have 39. United have more league titles, 20, and 13 of those have been won since Liverpool’s last league title in 1989-90. They also have more FA Cup wins than Liverpool (11), but fewer League Cups (four), fewer European Cups (three) and fewer other European trophies (one, the Cup-Winners Cup of 1990-91). The silverware has been totted up as part of a Sportsmail study to explore which English clubs are the ‘biggest’; 59 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been considered, having played in England’s top division for at least a season. John Barnes and Peter Beardsley celebrate in 1990 with the last league trophy to head to Liverpool . Steven Gerrard hoists Old Big Ears aloft after that famous night in Istanbul . Crowds . We ranked all clubs on the size of their average gates during this season to reflect contemporary pull. Then we ranked each club by the size of their biggest historic gates. Their overall crowd rank is an aggregate of current pull and also potential based on past highs. Global fanbase . We added up the total number of fans and followers for each club on Facebook and Twitter — by far the most popular global social media platforms. Every club has official accounts. Trophies . We counted ‘major’ trophies won by each club, giving points for each; 10pts for each European Cup/Champions League win, 8pts for each top-division English title, 5pts for each FA Cup or other European trophy win, and 3pts for each League Cup win. No ‘one-off’ trophies such as the Charity Shield are considered because they are not the product of multi-match competitions. And being a losing finalist does not count for points either — here at Sportsmail, winning is everything, second is nowhere. Average league finish . The average league finish position for each of the clubs since 1888-89. Player quality . We counted the number of players from each club who have played for England, all-time, ranking the clubs by total. This reflects historic ‘bigness’. We then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the 2014 World Cup — a measure of modern ‘bigness’. The overall ranking is an aggregate of these two. Income . We ranked the clubs by their income for the most recent season available. The biggest clubs have generally had the most money and been able to buy and pay the best players. The trophies considered as ‘major’ are those earned through playing a whole season, tournament or competition, so no ‘one-off match’ silverware has been included, such as the Charity Shield or Super Cup, nor have we counted silverware won in events that have ever been ‘one-off match’ occasions - like the Intercontinental Cup, which morphed into the Club World Cup. Some trophies are bigger than others; few would disagree a league title is more impressive than an FA Cup, or that a European Cup is bigger than a League Cup. So we have weighted the trophies, awarding 10 points for each European Cup, eight for each league title, five for an FA Cup or other European trophy and three for each League Cup win. In fact when the clubs are ranked 1 to 59 on total trophy wins without weighting, the order is very similar to the order when weightings have been applied. Liverpool stay at No1 for example ahead of United, themselves clear of Arsenal (28 trophies) in third, Aston Villa (20) in fourth and Chelsea (also 20) in fifth. When clubs have the same number of trophies the total points are used to separate them. Villa and Chelsea have both won a European Cup but Villa’s seven league titles to Chelsea’s four made the difference between that pair. When the points are the same, the club with the higher number of most important trophies are ranked higher. The full rankings of the ‘biggest’ clubs by trophies accompany this piece. Of the 59 teams in our study, 46 of them have won at least one major trophy. The 12 that haven’t are ranked by how closely they have come, for example as runners-up in the FA Cup (which is as close as Crystal Palace, Fulham and Hull among others have come), runners-up in the League Cup (Oldham) and then by the highest position they ever achieved in the top division. After the top five trophy winners come Everton and Tottenham in sixth and seventh places, Everton ahead on points because their nine league titles, the last of them in 1986-87, are far superior to Tottenham’s two titles, the second and last in 1960-61. Spurs are more cup specialists, having won eight FA Cups, four League Cups and three cups in Europe, albeit not the European Cup. Manchester City, Newcastle and Sunderland fill out the top 10 places, with rankings 10 to 20 dominated by former Premier League teams, among them Blackburn, Wolves, Nottingham Forest, Sheffield Wednesday, Leeds, Huddersfield, Sheffield United, Portsmouth and Preston among them, all of who have won the English title at least once and all of whom have won between four and 10 major trophies in their histories. Bolton in 23rd place are the highest-ranked club never to have won the title, and are 23rd courtesy of their four FA Cup wins. They are a place above West Ham, who have also never won the title and have won three FA Cups. Arsene Wenger and Tony Adams beam after Arsenal won the Double in 2002 .

104,"Philip Hammond will describe the 'greatest challenge to our collective security for decades' today . Britain faces the ‘greatest challenge’ to national security in decades, the foreign secretary will warn today. Philip Hammond will say evolving threats from a subversive Russia and the spread of Islamic extremism must be stopped before they harm the UK. In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute, the former defence secretary will say no-one can ‘confidently and accurately’ predict the source of the next major threat the UK faces. But intelligence agencies must be able to secretly identify, monitor and act against the range of threats in order to thwart terror plots and uncover clandestine weapons systems under development by the enemy. In a damning assessment of the dangers facing Britain, Mr Hammond will say: ‘…the sheer number and range of cases, old and new, amounts to the greatest challenge to our collective security for decades and places unprecedented demands on those charged with keeping us safe.’ He will say the country is now faced with a Russian leader ‘bent’ on subverting the international rules-based system which keeps the peace between nations. ‘President Putin’s actions… fundamentally undermine the security of sovereign nations in Eastern Europe’, he will say. Britain is being forced to cope with a greater range of threats, from state-sponsored aggression, to international terrorist organisations, to ‘lone wolf’ self-radicalised terrorists with the intent on damaging UK national security. The emergence of groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria and Islamic State in Syria, Iraq and Libya serves to underline the ‘pace’ with which the threats to Britain’s safety and security are ‘evolving’, he will claim. Mr Hammond will throw his weight behind plans for new laws to force internet companies to store email, web and social media records so they can be accessed by the security and intelligence agencies. The former defence secretary will describe Putin's actions as having 'undermined' the security of sovereign nations . He will say: ‘We must respond decisively and positively to the public and parliamentary debate about the powers required by our intelligence agencies to do their job in a changed technological environment – and in doing so draw a line under that debate so that the agencies can get on with the job of keeping this country safe.’ The security services warn that the law is failing to keep up with changing technology so their ability to track terrorists online is constantly diminishing. He will add: ‘As the range of threats gets bigger, so the pace of technological change with which the Agencies must keep up is getting faster, making their central task of keeping us safe ever more demanding.’ He will also speak of 'warped' view human rights activists have taken on the case of jihadi Mohammed Emwazi . The clandestine nature of some of the threats launched against us ‘require that we maintain a highly effective, secret capability to identify, monitor, and act against these threats before they can do us harm’, he will say. These include ‘the weapons systems that are developed in secrecy to threaten our national security.... and the great lengths that individual terrorists or terrorist organisations go to in order to try and keep their plots from being uncovered’. The head of the MI5, Andrew Parker, has warned that ‘if parts of the radar go dark’ and terrorists are beyond the reach of his agency, Britain would be more vulnerable to attack. Tory plans for new laws to require firms to store data on internet communications, so they can be accessed as part of an investigation, were blocked by the Lib Dems who brand them a ‘snoopers’ charter’. But David Cameron has pledged to revive them if this Tories are re-elected.

105,"Tony Pulis has demanded life bans for West Bromwich supporters who ripped out seats and threw them at rival fans at Villa Park. The furious West Brom manager also branded as ‘mindless idiots’ the hundreds of Aston Villa fans who invaded the pitch and goaded his players during Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final in scenes reminiscent of the 1970s. The FA are investigating the trouble, with Villa facing a large fine or even a partial stadium closure if negligence is established. West Brom manager Tony Pulis was disappointed that fans ripped out seats at Villa Park . Pulis compared scenes with fans on the pitch at Villa Park to trouble in the 1970s . Thousands of Villa supporters celebrated their win against West Brom by storming the pitch on Saturday . Questions will be asked about the meagre number of stewards, who were overwhelmed by a rush of Villa supporters. In 2010 West Ham were fined £115,000 for failing to control their fans when violence flared at a League Cup tie against Millwall. West Brom could also face sanctions over their fans, with one Villa supporter revealing to Sportsmail that he suffered a bloody head wound caused by a seat flung down from the upper section of the North Stand. Estimates suggested up to 25 chairs had been used as weapons. Pulis said: ‘Those supporters should never come into another ground. It is like people coming into someone else’s house — you have to show respect.’ West Bromwich  issued a stern statement on Sunday insisting they would show no tolerance towards any offenders. Chairman Jeremy Peace was said to have left the stadium in a rage. As thousands of Villa fans stormed on to the pitch to celebrate a 2-0 victory over their local rivals, many chose to swarm around West Brom players. West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace reportedly left the stadium furious about what happened . West Brom midfield player Callum McManaman was said to be involved in the most aggressive clash . Winger Callum McManaman was said to be involved in the most aggressive confrontation, while goalkeeper Boaz Myhill was repeatedly barged by yobs. Villa’s Fabian Delph, who scored his side’s first goal, said he was bitten by over-enthusiastic fans. ‘It was dangerous,’ he said. ‘Someone tried to take my boot off. People tried to kiss me and were biting me. It was scary.’ West Midlands Police said 17 arrests had been, while they are are also trying to identify people involved in a fracas before the match at the Witton Arms pub down the road from Villa Park. Villa issued a statement condemning the fans who poured over the barriers in the dying minutes of the game. ‘The club does not condone supporters invading the field under any circumstances. ‘We are very disappointed that what should have been a very memorable and proud moment was marred by the actions of those who could not control themselves. They have let both themselves and their club down. Villa could be in trouble from the Football Association for the crowd problems on Saturday . Fabian Delph scored in the game but the Aston Villa captain described the incident as 'scary' ‘The club extends its sincere apologies to the FA, the West Brom directors, Tony Pulis and all his staff and players.’ Pulis said: ‘It was like the Seventies and Eighties. I am old enough to have seen isolated incidents like that. Villa should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night, 5.30, you need to police it properly and I am sure Villa will look at it. ‘This is just hopefully an isolated incident with mindless idiots.’","Tony Pulis was dismayed at fan trouble during FA Cup match at Villa Park .

The force also published a photo of Louis on Facebook, along with new details on the search. The taunting response came from one of three accounts believed to belong to Mr Carroll, police said.

107,"A Seattle man fled the United States with his 9-year-old son on a sailboat last fall, taking his son thousands of miles away to the island nation of Niue, northeast of New Zealand. Jeffrey Ford Hanson pleaded guilty on Monday to one count of international parental kidnapping. Hanson's friends reportedly told police that the father had issues with alcohol and drugs, including crystal methamphetamine and oxycontin. Hanson's son, 9-year-old Billy, was visiting his father in July and was supposed to be sent back to his mother in Pennsylvania on Sept. 4, but the boy was not on the flight. The boy's mother contacted authorities and they issued a U.S. federal arrest warrant on Sept. 12. Family: Jeffrey Ford Hanson fled the United States with his 9-year-old son Billy on a sailboat last fall . Taking off: Hanson and his son were on his boat 'Draco' (pictured) Hanson and the boy's mother were divorced, but he had monthly visitation rights for up to six consecutive days, according to court records. Authorities found Hanson and the boy on Oct. 29 on Niue, which is located in the South Pacific Ocean and is northeast of New Zealand. They took Hanson into custody and worked to reunite the boy with his mother in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. Hanson's friends told Seattle Police Detective Bryan Van Brunt that Hanson lived on a boat, was dangerous and had a history of alcohol and drug abuse, according to an affidavit attached to a criminal complaint. One friend, Carey Jambresic, told Van Brunt that Hanson planned to take the boy by boat to Washington's San Juan Islands. Jambresic told the detective that the boy could not swim and said Hanson was actively smoking crystal methamphetamine, taking oxycontin and drinking alcohol, the affidavit said. Another friend, Dawnya Robinson, told the detective that Hanson sent her a text message saying he was leaving the country, going to Mexico and taking his son, the affidavit said. Discovery: Authorities found Billy and his father on Oct. 29 on the island country of Niue, located in the South Pacific Ocean, northeast of New Zealand . Hanson told another friend that he had enough money to keep his boat, Draco, afloat, and made references to Cape Horn on the southern tip of South America. Hanson was brought back to the U.S. in November where he was formally charged in a Los Angeles federal court. He was then moved to Seattle. He pleaded not guilty on Dec. 18 in U.S. District Court in Seattle and his trial was set for Feb. 17. It was later moved to May 11, but during a hearing early Monday, he changed his plea to guilty. Sentencing was set for June 6. Hanson faces up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000.","Jeffrey Ford Hanson fled the United States with his 9-year-old son Billy on a sailboat last fall .

108,"The battle over homegrown players overshadowed the Premier League, FA and Government’s get-together on Friday in a fanciful show of harmony to promote grassroots facilities. The League’s opposition to FA chairman Greg Dyke’s campaign to increase the homegrown players in their squads from eight to 12 made pictures of Dyke, PL chief executive Richard Scudamore and Minister for Sport Helen Grant at a new 3G pitch in Brixton rather incongruous, especially as how the money will be spent or who will administer it has not been decided. ‘The nitty gritty will be worked out,’ promised Grant on her last day in office before the election, just when she’s starting to looking the part. Greg Dyke’s has a campaign to increase the homegrown players in their squads from eight to 12 . The PL want to kick Dyke’s project into the long grass, claiming it will never get through the necessary committees on which the League have seats. Dyke has ridden back from his aggressive approach on Monday when he said the FA had looked into forcing change but did not want to do so. When Southampton asked Dyke at the clubs’ summit if he was going to force it through — as the FA could — he denied he’d said that. Instead, there will be a consultation process with an FA document arriving soon which the PL and their clubs will inevitably reject. Scudamore said: ‘We haven’t actually seen the consultation document, we haven’t seen the process. When that arrives, we will consult properly on it.’ The FA’s best hope is that UEFA can persuade the European Commissioner to allow 12 home-grown players in Champions League squads. Minister for Sport Helen Grant's appearance at a new 3G pitch in Brixton was rather overshadowed . The non-stop spin about who’s giving what to grassroots football was in full force. Scudamore, Dyke and Grant were each accompanied by at least two of their PR team or policy advisors, all spinning like tops over a supposedly joint initiative. It was likened to a three-legged stool by Scudamore, who added: ‘They fall over if any one of the legs gets sawn off.’ The three speeches at the UEFA Congress from Sepp Blatter’s challengers for the FIFA presidency do not seem to have had much impact on voters. According to his supporters, Blatter  is still on course for a ridiculous fifth term in office with a landslide 160 territories out of 209, which explains why he doesn’t feel the need to go out on the campaign trail. That support includes around half of the UEFA countries, which is the percentage estimated by the Slovenia and Iceland delegations in Vienna. According to his supporters, Sepp Blatter is still on course for a fifth term in office . FA of Wales’ loveable loose cannon president Trefor Lloyd Hughes gave the impression he didn’t really know where he stood at the UEFA Congress over his noisy claims to the British vice-presidency on the FIFA ExCo because it was Wales’s turn. And this was borne out by his official FAW statement congratulating the successful candidates after the elections in ‘Vienna, Switzerland’. FA cutting to the Max . The FA’s desire to find 15 per cent cuts from every department to fund the England commission coaches and pitches initiative doesn’t stop them bringing in costly management consultants Maxxim to find more efficient ways for football’s ruling body to work. Complaints from the national game about the proposed cuts to the FA Trophy and Vase prizemoney brought the FA board response that sponsors should be found by the commercial department. Hardly likely when the flagship FA Cup has been without a backer all season. Four second places in the Six Nations is not stopping England head coach Stuart Lancaster talking about coming first for a change. His latest speaking engagement, for the NSPCC, is a glitzy evening with himself and Jonny Wilkinson at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London on April 23 talking to 450 guests about ‘What it takes to Win’. Whether it’s advisable, even for a good cause, for Lancaster, with his track record, to be talking in tandem with a fabled World Cup winner is debatable. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie chats to Lancaster at England's base in Pennyhill Park in Bagshot . The ECB are negotiating a car deal for England with Toyota set to replace Jaguar.

109,"Spanish paella, pulled pork burger, red velvet cupcakes - These all sound like delicacies from an upscale restaurant not meals for our pooches. But Asia Upward wanted to be quirky and combine her love for food photography with her love for her dogs, and thus the book 'A Dog's World' was born. She told Daily Mail Australia that she wanted to raise the stakes and come up with something quirky that would humour people and wasn't the everyday image. So she substituted humans for dogs. Scroll down for video . Asia Upward has released a book that combines recipes for dogs and photography titles 'A Dog's World' She said she wanted to raise the stakes and come up with something quirky that wasn't the everyday image. Asia has tested out most of her recipes on her 10-year-old Ridgeback cross cattle dog, Bear . 'I am based in Melbourne and what I have noticed is that there is always a new trend, like the pulled-pork fad,' she said. Mash the banana thoroughly. Add all of the ingredients into a food processor or blender and mix until smooth. Place mixture into ice cube trays and freeze. Once frozen they are ready to serve. 'I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great to do this for my dog - so I did and then started brainstorming more and more ideas for dog recipes.' Recipes that you will come across in the book range from icy pole bones to winter warming vegetable soup and her personal favourite - red velvet pupcakes. The healthiness of the meal for the dog is paramount to Asia, so with the cupcakes, she uses beetroot to get the deep red colour and sugar-free yogurt for the icing. So as delicious as these meals appear in the images to anyone's eye, they are aimed purely at dogs. 'I actually ate the pulled-pork burger once,' Asia said. 'There is obviously no seasoning in any of the meals, its really simple plain food, so I had to add some relish.' Recipes in the book range from icy pole bones to winter warming vegetable soup and red velvet pupcakes. Asia used Gumtree to source the dogs as she was new to Melbourne and did not know many dog owners . Her inspiration for the book has stemmed from her deep, childhood love for dogs . Asia tested out most of the recipes on her 10-year-old half ridgeback and half cattle dog, Bear. Her mum rescued Bear from the blue mountains when he was 4-weeks-old. He was the runt of a litter of puppies whose mother could not adequately care for them so he has been with Asia ever since. Her inspiration for the book has stemmed from her deep, childhood love for dogs. 'I found a picture of myself when I was three-years-old at my parents house absolutely surrounded by dogs,' she said. 'I didn't have many kids to play with, so I had pets my entire life instead.' Further motivation came when the Melbourne-based photographer was travelling in Sumatra and experienced the strewn mange, disease and dejection of the street dogs. 'I found a picture of myself when I was three-years-old at my parents house absolutely surrounded by dogs' Motivation for the book came when she was travelling in Sumatra and experienced the disease and dejection of the street dogs . Icy pole bones with natural low fat yogurt, 1 banana, peanut butter and honey . Asia is planning another trip to Sri Lanka in September to advocate animal welfare . 'There was a tiny puppy crossing the road in front of the car, skinny and sick so I asked the driver if we could do something and he just laughed at me,' she said. 'It broke my heart.' Chop and brown the beef hearts . Put the browned meat and other ingredients into large pot and bring to boil . Reduce heat once boiling and simmer covered for 30 minutes . Serve at room temperature with brown rice . As soon as Asia returned home she began working on her book and with its release, she aims to raise awareness and funds for Animal SOS Sri Lanka, a charity dedicated to not only rescuing street animals but also educating the people of Sri Lanka in animal welfare. She is planning another trip over there on the 20th of September to help Animal SOS campaign and advertise their strong message. On being asked how she sourced the pooches for the shoot, Asia admitted it was not the most orthodox method. 'Believe it or not, I used Gumtree,' she laughed. 'I was new to Melbourne and didn't know any dog owners so I put an ad up on Gumtree and was taken aback by how many people responded. Asia evidently could not use them all but is keeping everyone in mind for her second book as the characters that she found on set were priceless. 'There was a little French Bulldog who was hilarious, I wanted to get a shot of him looking at the cake but he just launched into it and devoured the entire thing before even looking at it.'","Asia Upward released a photography and recipe book titled 'A Dog's World'

111,"Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano is set to push for migrant screening and processing centres in Africa, at meetings with his EU counterparts in Brussels . Italy is to outline proposals to fast-track African migrants and send them directly to EU countries including Britain. Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano is set to push for migrant screening and processing centres in Africa, at meetings with his EU counterparts in Brussels tomorrow. Mr Alfano claims that the migrant crisis should be tackled with refugee camps on African soil, where asylum seekers could be identified and then distributed evenly throughout European states. The minister’s proposals come as the EU border chief warned that there are up to a million migrants in Libya preparing to cross the Mediterranean. Italy, with its southernmost landfall just a 80km (49 miles) from Africa, is the first port of call for many seeking new lives in Europe. With Libya descending into ever-worsening chaos and lawlessness, almost 9,000 migrants arrived on Italian shores in January and February, up 43 per cent on last year’s record figures. Fabrice Leggeri director of EU border control Frontex said: ‘Our sources tell us there are anywhere between 500,000 to a million people ready to leave from Libya.’ ‘We have to be ready to address a more difficult situation than last year.’ With militias loyal to the Islamic State making frightening inroads in Libya, it is feared that jihadis could enter Europe by boat hidden among migrants. Minister Alfano, of the centre-right NCD party, said the solution has to be found in Africa: ‘We must resolve the problem at its origin. There are two paths, stabilise Libya and create refugee camps in . Africa so that the screening is done there, and those who have the right to asylum are identified with a balanced distribution between the European countries.’ He told Italian television La 7 in advance of the meeting that Libya has become ‘an international priority.’ ‘The camps would do a preventative screening,’ he said. ‘Who has refugee status would be distributed in a balanced way among various European countries, those who aren’t would not be given permission to leave.’ Italy is the first place many people arrive when seeking a new life in Europe. These migrants were rescued from the sea after the boat they were travelling in capsised . Three of the camps would be based in Niger, Tunisia and Sudan, according to Italian media reports. Natasha Bertaud, spokesman for the EU executive, said the plans were in an ‘orientation phase’ . She said the Commission was ‘aware that some member states are in discussions to develop centres in North . Africa and are in contact with the International Organisation for Migration and UNHCR about the possibility of developing centres for migrants to facilitate screening and logistics for the voluntary return of economic migrants, as well as identifying those who need help.’ A pilot project in Niger is under discussion, she said. Deploying liaison officers in third party countries is ‘a long term project’ she said. It is thought up to a million people might be willing to make the crossing from Libya. Pictured: A group of migrants arrived in Lampedusa few days ago, arrive in the harbour of Lampedusa to be transferred to Sicily . The proposals are likely to meet opposition in norther European states that may bear the brunt of a future quota system. But the plans were welcomed in Italy. Centre left PD Senator Luigi Manconi head of the Human Rights commission said: ‘I learn with satisfaction that minister Alfano will present tomorrow in Brussels a project for the opening with the UNHCR and the IOM of at least three migration centres which would allow them to process asylum requests for Europe. ‘The facilities would be created by the EU in conjunction with international humanitarian organisations to two ends: avoiding the illegal crossings of the Mediterranean with the risks that it brings and distributing the asylum seekers in Europe according to balanced reception quotas.’","Italian interior minister to push for migrant screening centres in Africa .

'The same goes for Nick Easter, who has really impressed in camp and in his appearances off the bench. 'Nick is a quality ball carrier and great defender - things we feel we'll need in the latter stages of the game.'

113,"West Ham striker Carlton Cole has accepted a Football Association charge over a Twitter exchange with a Tottenham supporter. Cole had until 6pm on Thursday night to respond to the charge of making a comment which 'was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper and/or brings the game into disrepute'. A FA independent commission will now meet to decide his sanction, with no limit to the possible punishment. West Ham United striker Carlton Cole has admitted an FA charge for a tweet that the FA deemed abusive . Cole tweeted back to a Tottenham fan who had insulted him on Twitter, telling the  supporter: 'F off you c***' The charge related to Cole's involvement in a Twitter altercation with a Spurs fan following West Ham's 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw at White Hart Lane on February 22. The 31-year-old, who has 122,000 followers on the social networking site, was responding to a message from Spurs supporter Stuart Hardy that read: 'Hi @CarltonCole1 when your own team-mates don't kick the ball out when you're lying injured for 2 mins, you think it's time to call it a day?'

114,"They were the Kardashians of the 70's - attractive, wealthy and dysfunctional. They were the Louds: Pat and Bill and their five children, ranging from age 14 to 20 - Lance, Delilah, Grant, Kevin and Michele. The Louds were the subjects of the first ever television reality show, An American Family, broadcast on PBS in twelve hour-long episodes beginning on January 11, 1973. The show took viewers up close and personal in the home of the Loud family of Santa Barbara, California. Parents Pat and Bill and their kids became household names living in front of the camera for seven months taped the year prior to the broadcast. A record ten million weekly viewers were riveted watching the Loud family's lives falling apart. On camera, Pat asked her husband, Bill to move out, and Lance, the oldest son, was the first gay to come out on television. Pat Loud, with the editorial help of Christopher Makos, is about to reissue reissued a collection of photographs, writings and personal papers of her son Lance for the book, Lance Out Loud, published by Glitterati Incorporated in conjunction with the acquisition of the private memorabilia by Yale University. The Originals: Pat and Bill Loud and their five children ranging from age 14 to 20 -- Lance, Delilah, Grant, Kevin and Michele - were the subjects of the first ever television reality show, An American Family, broadcast on PBS in 1973 . Keeping Up: The Kardashians have had their own share of scandals over the years. Keeping Up with the Kardashians was first broadcast in 2007. They are top row, from left: Brandon Jenner and Burton Jenner; middle row from left: Brody Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Bruce Jenner, Kris Jenner, Cassandra Jenner, Kim Kardashian; and front row from left: Rob Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian . Coming out: Oldest son Lance was the first person to reveal he was gay on television. Affectionate letters from friends honoring the memory of Lance describe him as loving Warhol, wind chimes, thrift shops, yard sales, Latin men, talking on the phone, cats, riding on his motorcycle and every taco stand in LA. Special contempt was directed at Lance for his 'flamboyant, leechlike, homosexuality'. The New York Times described him as 'camping and queening about like a pathetic court jester, a Goya-esque emotional dwarf'. Voyeuristic eyes were mesmerized by the watershed cinema verité event - viewing unscripted moments in the family's life that the press described as exhibitionist and as 'affluent zombies'. Special contempt was directed at Lance for his 'flamboyant, leechlike, homosexuality'. The New York Times described him as 'camping and queening about like a pathetic court jester, a Goya-esque emotional dwarf'. Lance Loud, who died of complications from AIDS in 2001, stated: 'Television ate my family.' He believed the documentary series fulfilled 'the middle-class dream that you can become famous for being just who you are'. He didn't shy away from coming out on television but reveled in the positive feedback he received from the gay community. He became a penpal of Andy Warhol and flamboyantly embraced his own role as a gay icon. He moved to New York to be close to Warhol's Factory, the artist's studio that became a magnet for artists, socialites and hipsters. Lance needed a new landscape that gave him the freedom to be gay --- and to escape northern Californian hippies. Lance was 'pursued by his own demons and turned to drugs to keep them at bay', his mother Pat writes . Affectionate letters from friends honoring the memory of Lance describe him as loving Warhol, wind chimes, thrift shops, yard sales, Latin men, talking on the phone, cats, riding on his motorcycle and every taco stand in LA. It was the time of Free Love when sexuality was celebrated. 'If it feels good, do it' trend swept the country and Lance right along with it. He wanted to live art, live music, be in the music. 'Lance loved movies, food, music, fashion and anything with a horizontal stripe', his sister Delilah writes. 'Never seduced by fame, he wore it as a loose garment. 'Many considered him an icon for coming out on TV. Those who believe that have it backwards; Lance was too impatient to wait for the rest of us, so he ran ahead and scouted the rapids to tell us that the water was fine.' But Lance was 'pursued by his own demons and turned to drugs to keep them at bay', his adoring mother Pat recalls. Author and book editor Ellis Amburn, a friend of Lance wrote, 'In a world that could be cruel and catty, I never heard Lance say an unkind word about anyone, and I always found his blithe spirit contagious.' American Family wasn't anything like the family thought it would be. Pat Loud, now 89, discussed the show and revealed that there wasn't anything negative brewing in their family until the camera and the producer arrived . She told the New York Times in 2013 that the Public Broadcasting Network and the New York affiliate, WNET, viewed the family as California airheads and coerced her into asking her husband for a divorce on camera. She is now happily living again with her ex-husband, Bill, who is 94. The couple has their own Facebook account under the Loud Family. Lance holding a photo of himself in drag. 'Television ate my family,' said Lance. American Family wasn't anything like the Louds thought it would be . An American Family was a premonition of reality TV, an unrehearsed voyeuristic eye, unlike the reality shows of today. Craig Gilbert, the creator of An American Family, never worked again after the documentary aired in 1973. He spent subsequent years avoiding the notoriety that came with the show and charges that he had exploited the Louds and betrayed their trust. 'It was pretty damn tumultuous, and I don't want to go over it again', he told the New Yorker in 2011 when he was 85 and recovering from an accidental overdose of the cough suppressant Mucinex. Rumors swirled at the time of filming that Gilbert had an affair with Pat Loud that both parties denied. The married couple, Alan and Susan Raymond who were hired to record sound, 'balked at capturing several of the series's rawest moments', according to Dennis Lim's story in the New Yorker. Pat Loud is now happily living with ex-husband Bill again . Susan Raymond told Lim that 'Gilbert had a 'Svengali hold' on Pat Loud' and 'Craig destroyed that family'. Gilbert got a late-night phone call from Pat after the show began broadcasting ranting about the negative stories in the press about her family. 'What have I done? What do I do? He asked himself. 'I never resolved it. I don't know what I had wrought. I still don't'.

115,"Researchers studying nature have turned to a new frontier they say could be more diverse than anmost anywhere else - homes. They say indoor spaces could be the fastest growing biome, a word used to describe the different realms of life on Earth. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, researchers say. A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document the inhabitants. It found more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa. Another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders . An examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. A review paper published March 19 in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution serves as a call for research in the emerging field of indoor biome ecology and evolution. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, for example, from the pest management field, or public health perspectives on microbes. The paper came out of a 2013 workshop that included the evolutionary biology of the built environment, which included evolutionary, microbial and plant biologists, entomologists, architects, scientists who study better building design, and others. 'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin of Cornell, the paper's first author. 'But given the number of species found indoors, it is likely there's a lot more going on that we don't know about.' A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa; another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders; and an examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. 'I've been noticing more species inside my house since I went to this working group,' Martin said, referring to the 2013 workshop. Co-author Robert Dunn, of North Carolina State University, discovered a species of parasitic wasp that lays its eggs inside cockroaches in his house. 'The radical diversity in abiotic environments, such as in water heaters, freezers and on kitchen counters, is vast and could parallel microclimates found on forest floors,' said Martin. The paper notes that the first human houses date back 20,000 years and that today's indoor environments most closely resemble caves. The emerging field also holds potential for studying rapid evolution, as the development of human-built environments has been recent. Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches: Researchers called for more research into pests, saying the home was an untapped resource. Close up of a bedbug on skin.'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin, the paper's first author and a graduate student in the field of natural resources. Researchers say they have many questions regarding the indoor evolution -  such as whether species found indoors were pre-adapted to indoor environments or whether they have adapted to them; and how the indoors might drive the evolution of new species. They also hope to compare species in Alaska, for example, with species in Texas; whether outdoor environments determine what happens indoors; which indoor species are healthful to have; and how home design can contribute to health and indoor species compositions. 'We are interested in reframing the dialogue away from what gross or dangerous pests live in houses to what biodiversity exists in houses,' Martin said.","Researchers say homes are a hotbed of undiscovered species .

116,"In the wake of Manchester City’s recent Barclays Premier League defeat by Liverpool, the first thing the club’s Brazilian midfielder Fernando did was seek out compatriot Philippe Coutinho. ‘I wanted to say ‘‘well done’’ to him after his winning goal,’ revealed Fernando. ‘To me, he is the best Brazilian playing in Europe at the moment.’ Elsewhere at Anfield, the criticism of the City midfield that had started after the home defeat by Barcelona four days earlier was being cranked up to the next level. Fernando admits he is finding life in the Premier League tough in his first season since moving from Porto . Fernando (right) and Fernandinho (left) attends a Disability Awareness Workshop with local kids on Thursday . Fernando says Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, tracked by his mate Fernandinho, is the best current Europe-based Brazilian player . According to those on TV paid to know, City had lost back-to-back games simply because of failings in central midfield. Fernando played in the first game and not the second. Was he, therefore, at least partly culpable for setbacks that seem to have done so much to damage City’s aspirations at home and in the Champions League? Fernando: 'I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem' ‘It’s really hard,’ Fernando admitted on Thursday. ‘I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem. The Premier League is very challenging. ‘This season has gone OK, I think, but I’m hoping my next season will be a lot better. It was really difficult against Barcelona. We were not playing a normal team. ‘We want to get to that level but we need to learn if we are going to be successful in the Champions League. We know we can win in Barcelona. But having an attacking mentality won’t help us if we go over the top with that. Our mentality has to be right. ‘The criticism will always come if things aren’t going well. It can be aimed at the strikers or the defence and now at this time it is the midfield. It shouldn’t do but that is just what happens.’ City’s shot at European redemption comes next Wednesday at the Nou Camp. Manuel Pellegrini’s team trail 2-1 and need a huge result if they are going to become an isolated Premier League representative in the last eight. At home, City trail Chelsea in the Premier League by five points and have played a game more. On Tuesday, Fernando watched Jose Mourinho’s team exit Europe in a rather feisty game at Stamford Bridge. On a night more memorable for needle than football, it was tempting to wonder if Chelsea were beginning to show signs of frailty. The Brazilian midfielder has come under fire as part of the under-performing City midfield, but showed some skills playing sitting volleyball for school children in Manchester . Fernando, who says mentality will be the most important factor for City in their bid to turn around a 2-1 margin against Barcelona in the Champions League last-16, attempts to play football with a blindfold . Certainly Fernando revealed he could not imagine his City team-mates hounding a referee in similar fashion. He did, however, have an interesting take on why some footballers - including friends such as David Luiz, Oscar and Thiago Silva - behave the way they do. ‘It’s not something that would happen in our team,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘We are mainly a very calm team that concentrates on actually trying to win the game on the pitch. ‘We play according to whatever happens and we don’t try to change things by altering decisions and trying to influence the result that way. The 27-year-old is assisted by a girl during the appearance as part of City in the Community . ‘Every player has to hold things in. There are so many occasions when you actually want to say things but you must not. ‘At City I follow the example of people like James Milner, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta. They are players who just try to play and not talk too much. ‘But you have to understand that the Champions League is a huge competition and the players were aware of that on Tuesday. ‘It was two great teams wanting to go through. ‘The players were aware of the investment each club had made so they had that pressure too. ‘The players were tense and that’s why these things happen. It’s adrenaline and tension.’ On Thursday at City’s training base, Fernando and his team-mate and fellow Brazilian Fernandinho took part in a Disability Awareness Workshop with local schoolchildren organised by the club’s City in the Community scheme. So close are the two that when Fernandinho was chosen for random doping after training, his friend waited for him before arriving to take part in the event. Fernando was also there at Anfield, of course, when Fernandinho and City captain Vincent Kompany had a rather frank exchange of views about what was going wrong. ‘In every team and every player there is a need to talk,’ he said. ‘It has to happen. It helps. We are working to improve when things are going wrong. It’s a quality and we will carry on with that. 'Fernandinho isn’t even a tiny bit upset about. It’s a story for a day and people like to talk but it means nothing to us.’ Back at home in Brazil, they are still coming to terms with their own bad news day. That came last July when the national team flunked a World Cup semi-final, losing 7-1 to Germany. Fernando watched that game in a Brazilian restaurant in Manchester and put his hands to his head at mention of it yesterday. Now 27, he has international aspirations of his own but knows he - and his country - have much to learn. Chelsea players remonstrate with referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends of Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Fernando attempts to hold off Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso as he continues to find his feet in England . ‘It is really hard for Brazil now,’ he said. ‘We have had to learn a lesson from what happened. ‘The Germans and the Dutch have improved and we needed to realise that we have to catch up. ‘Tactically we have fallen behind. If I get called up then of course I will be extremely happy. I am focused on my performance here, though. ‘Every players needs time to get settled and get his status. This is what I am doing.’ Isaias paved the way for Brazilians in the Premier League on his signing with Coventry in 1995 . FIRST BRAZILIAN IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE (AND FIRST GOAL SCORER): . Isaias Marques Soares, aka Isaias, signed for Coventry from Benfica in the summer of 1995.

118,"A schoolgirl who suffers from a rare condition which means she could die at any time has written a heart-breaking bucket list. Harlee-Jae Procter, from Bacup, Lancashire, told her mother Sasha she wants to ride an elephant, ice-skate with her favourite Frozen character and be a zoo keeper. The four-year-old has spent much of her short life in hospital due to a rare condition which means that part of a chromosome has been lost or deleted. Brave: Harlee-Jae Procter, who has a condition which means she could die at any moment, has come up with a bucket list of things she would love to do . As a result the tot has been diagnosed with biliary atresia which causes inflammation of the bile ducts, polycystic kidneys and nephrocalcinosis, a build up of calcium in the kidneys which can lead to fatal renal failure. 'Harlee-Jae is such a character and people who meet her don't think there is anything wrong with her,' said the mother-of-two. 'After we were told that she could have renal failure at any time, we decided to come up with a list of things she wants to do. 'And I think she realised she could take advantage of it a bit - so there are things on her list that are possible and some things that will never happen. 'It's really scary thinking that the worst could happen to her at any minute so we just want to make as many memories as we can. But I don't let her conditions define her or how she is treated.' And the youngster - who still wears age 12-months clothes because her growth has been stunted - has already started to tick items off. Pilot Procter: Harlee-Jae Procter (left) and sister Codiee-Lee (right) has already started to tick things off her bucket list like being a pilot . List: Harlee-Jae Procter (right) who has a serious healt condition, pictured with sister Codiee-Lee. The pair spent a day as police officers as part of the four-year-old's bucket list . She has already flown in an airplane cockpit, met Elmo, and spent the day as a police officer at Rossendale police station where they organised for her to go on a police car ride, a tour of the police station, and take part in fingerprinting and handcuffing. Sasha said: 'She came up with the bucket list after we were taken to PortAventura in Spain in August by the Make a Wish Foundation to meet Elmo from Sesame Street. 'She had a great time and even got to go in the cockpit of the plane on the flight over. 'Her list is full of things - some are achievable but some will never happen. She wants to ride an elephant, ice skate with Elsa from Frozen, be a zoo keeper and meet Danny Ings.

She has extremely rare diagnosis of microdeletion 17 q12 syndrome which means that genetic information has been lost or deleted . 'It's about making memories. I don't want to just sit here crying and let her condition define our lives.' The brave youngster was diagnosed with biliary atresia at just four-weeks-old after she was born severely jaundice. She was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary for a Kasai procedure which drains bile from the liver to the gut. The operation improved her liver function but Harlee will still need a liver transplant before she reaches adulthood. Frozen: One of Harlee-Jae Procter's wishes is to ice-skate with her favourite Disney character Princess Elsa . Fun loving: Harlee-Jae Procter, four, doesn't let her potentially fatal condition stop her from doing what she wants. She has come up with a bucket list of things she would like to do . The reception pupil was then diagnosed with polycystic kidneys at six-months, followed by an extremely rare diagnosis of microdeletion 17 q12 syndrome which means that genetic information has been lost or deleted. And more recently Harlee-Jae was found to have nephrocalcinosis which has to be monitored at monthly hospital visits, and could prove fatal. The brave girl has to take 15 different types of medication every day - and her condition has also made it difficult to potty train leaving her embarrassed at school. Sasha, who is also mother to six-year-old Codiee-Lee, said: 'All of this has been going on since she was born and Harlee deals with it really well. 'She doesn't think there is anything wrong with her and thinks I am lying when I tell her - she tells people the scar from her op is from falling off her bike.'","'Riding an elephant' and 'ice-skating with Elsa from Frozen' on tragic list .

119,"Militants fighting for the Islamic State have released horrific images of an alleged thief having his hand hacked off in its latest warped display of justice. The photographs show two masked 'surgeons' unpacking a briefcase containing meat cleavers, bandages and a chopping board  in front of a baying crowd of onlookers. A suspect,  reportedly convicted of stealing a motorbike after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court, is then frogmarched to a table where his right hand is doused in some form of sterilizing fluid. His hand is then held down on a chopping board while a militant lops it off with a cleaver. Warped justice: Two Islamic State 'surgeons' unpack a briefcase containing meat cleavers, a chopping board and some form of sterilizing fluid before chopping the hand off a thief accused of stealing a motorbike . The alleged thief's right hand is doused in sterilizing fluid to help prevent infection after the amputation . Barbaric: The thief's hand in hacked off with a meat cleaver while being held down on a chopping board . Before the sentencing, the images show crowds of onlookers, including young children, surrounding the table while a fighter appears to read out the charges. It is latest in a string of sickening amputations carried out by ISIS in Iraq and Syria in recent weeks. The photographs, like previous one, were shared by pro-ISIS social media users, who use the Arabic file sharing website Nasher to exchange images of the terror group's latest atrocities. The images are high quality  and carry the distinctive yellow branding of the group's Al-Hayat Media Center, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video. It comes just days after photographs taken in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul showed in gruesome detail how the terrorists pump their victims full of drugs before using a massive meat cleaver to cut off the hands. Last month, Islamic State released a document on social media, explaining the rules of Islamic State penal code, which is being brutally enforced across ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq. Entitled 'Clarification [regarding] the Hudud', the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the Islamic State, in accordance with the extremist group's radical interpretation of Shariah law. All punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court. After the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city. Sick spectacle: A baying crowd of onlookers gather round after being encouraged to watch the amputation . Iron rule: Heavily armed militants monitor the crowds which include children as young a five years old . A militant holds what appears to be a charge sheet which is read out before the sentence is carried out . Men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments. An Islamic State fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public. All forms of blasphemy against Islam are punished by execution, even if the accuser chooses to repent of their sins. Likewise, committing murder, spying, apostasy or sodomy is punished by immediate death. Anyone found guilty of banditry, specifically murder and stealing, is put to death by crucifixion. According to Islamic State's reading of Shariah law, thieves have a hand cut off. It is unclear whether the victim can choose which hand is removed. Islamic State's penal code also states that anyone found guilty of banditry and caught stealing will have their right hand and their left leg amputated. This terrible punishment is done so that every member of the public can identify the victim's past crime. Flogging is another common punishment carried out under Islamic State. Getting ready: In a previous amputation, the men's arms are pumped full of drugs and wrapped in tight bandages both to lessen the agony  and to reduce the amount of blood flowing from the open wound . Agony: After having his hand hacked off, the victim is seen receiving medical treatment to ensure the wound does not become infected . Sick: The victim is seen pinned in a chair by a group of men, one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist, ready to strike .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

She posted a graphic of the tips, writing: 'These are great - send to all the men in ur life.' But dozens of angry men on Twitter seized on her joke, tweeting in to call her 'sexist' and saying it was 'offensive' to imply that all men are looking for ways to rape women. A tongue-in-cheek list of rape prevention tips that are aimed at the attacker have gone viral on Twitter . Sarah Silverman tweeted the list with a post advising people to 'send it to all the men in ur life' Although the Ten Rape Prevention Tips have been shared and favourited thousands of times, the comedian faced a backlash on social media, with men calling them 'degrading' and 'sexist'. The sarcastic set of rules, which focus on the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim, also include 'if you are in an elevator and a woman gets in, don't rape her', as well as 'when you encounter a woman who is asleep, the safest course of action is not to rape her'. Number nine on the list is 'carry a rape whistle. If you find you are about to rape someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you'. And the final one reads: 'Don't forget, honesty is the best policy. When asking a woman out on a date, don't pretend that you are interested in her as a person; tell her straight up that you expect to be raping her later. If you don't communicate your intentions, the woman may take it as a sign that you do not plan to rape her.' Silverman is currently dating Welsh actor Michel Sheen - whom she has been with since January 2014. Before that, she had a highly publicized romance with late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, whom she dated for five years until they split in 2008. The set of tips was first shared in a blog on Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence back in 2011. The post was uploaded by Leigh Hofheimer who said a co-worker had produced the set of rules. Comedian Sarah Silverman shared the list over Twitter dividing the opinion . Silverman's tweet left many men feeling offended . Social media users said the list suggested  all men were capable of such crimes . Hofheimer wrote: 'I couldn’t decide if I should laugh or be horrified by the reality that violence prevention tips are always aimed at what the targeted person should do (judgment strongly implied) to protect themselves.' Despite being almost four years old, the list has caused controversy after being tweeted by the comedian. Silverman's tweet has received a mixed reaction from the public. Although Silverman did not write the list some users attacked her directly in response to the list . However several users argued that the list pointed out that victims are too often blamed for their attacks . The list has divided opinions with some feminists arguing it shows it is not victims who need to change their behaviour but the attacker. D Kramer wrote: 'I get the point, we always tells the women they are responsible to prevent rape & not the men.' However, men on Twitter have hit out at the list implying that it's all men who would commit such crimes. Silverman has been dating Welsh actor Michael Sheen (left) since January 2014. Before that, she was with Jimmy Kimmel (right) for five years . Zac Lee posted: 'It's extremely offensive. It implies that it's common for men to think about ways to rape girls, when that's nonsense.' Another user wrote: 'This is so offensive to men. What an awful subtext you're propagating.' And Paul Jukes tweeted: 'Rather harsh on those of us who, you know, wouldn't dream of hurting anyone.' User Ben Morpy wrote: 'I feel like battling sexism with sexist propaganda is the best way to promote sexism.' This is not Silverman's first controversial tweet involving rape. In November last year, the 44-year-old comedian came under fire for tweeting a gag about being sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby. She later removed the post and edited it after causing offense online.","Sarah Silverman tweeted an image of the ten rape prevention tips .

122,"Only 12 men have scored in every round of the FA Cup in its 143-year history. Bradford’s Jon Stead hopes he can join them — and he’ll be one step closer if he nets against Reading in their quarter-final on Saturday. Here are the fascinating stories behind the deadly dozen... Archie Hunter (Aston Villa, winners 1887) The Scot was one of the first footballing celebrities of the Victorian era. ‘Old Warhorse’ captained Villa to their first FA Cup with a 2-0 victory over West Brom at the Kennington Oval. Forced to retire in 1890 after a heart attack on the pitch, he later died of heart failure aged 35. Archie Hunter of Aston Villa was one of the first footballing celebrities of the Victorian era . Sandy Brown (Tottenham, winners 1901) Hailing from the same Ayrshire mining village as Bill Shankly, Brown was known as the ‘Glenbuck Goalgetter’. Spurs became the only non-League side to win the FA Cup thanks to his goals. During Brown’s Scotland debut against England, part of the terracing at Ibrox collapsed, killing 25 fans. Sandy Brown (circled), pictured with Tottenham's FA Cup winning team, was a fine goalscorer in the cup . Harry Hampton (Aston Villa, winners 1905) ‘The Whirlwind’ remains Villa’s all-time leading scorer in League football with 215 goals. He was a fearless forward and once scored having barged 22-stone goalkeeper William ‘Fatty’ Foulke over the line with the ball in his arms. He served at the Somme during World War One and survived a poisonous gas attack. Harry Hampton (circled) puts Aston Villa 1-0 up against Newcastle United in the FA Cup final in 1905 . Harold Blackmore (Bolton, winners 1929) Blackmore was a goalscoring sensation as a teenager playing for Silverton, a village team in Devon. He also worked at the local paper mill before signing for Exeter City and then moving to Bolton for £2,150, a princely sum in 1927. It looked as though his chance of scoring in every round had gone as Bolton led Portsmouth 1-0 at Wembley, but Blackmore netted at the death to seal his place in history. Harold Blackmore signed for Bolton for over 2,000 and scored in every round of the 1929 FA Cup . Ellis Rimmer (Sheffield Wednesday, winners 1935) The Scouser was a showman, attracting big crowds as a jazz pianist. Left winger Rimmer was the first non-striker to score in every round after his late brace in the 4-2 win over West Brom. The England man later ran the Hallamshire House pub in Sheffield before returning to Formby, where he died aged 58. Ellis Rimmer was a showman for Sheffield Wednesday, and was the first non-striker to score in every round . Frank O’Donnell (Preston, runners-up 1937) The Scot was one of 15 siblings and played in the final against Sunderland alongside brother Hugh, as well as Bill Shankly. O’Donnell became the first player to score in every round but end on the losing team. He died 15 years later in Macclesfield aged just 40 after a short illness. A tribute in Glasgow’s Evening Times described him as one of the finest players of his generation. Frank O'Donnell was in fine form for Preston in 1937, though his side lost the final . Stan Mortensen (Blackpool, runners-up 1948) Mortensen is better known for becoming in 1953 the only player to score a hat-trick in an FA Cup final. Five years earlier his side lost to Manchester United as he became the first post-war player to score in every round. A Blackpool legend, there is a statue of him outside Bloomfield Road. He died aged 69 in 1991, just nine days before Blackpool appeared at Wembley for the first time since the 1953 final. Stan Mortensen (second left, centre row) in a Blackpool team photo with Stanley Matthew to the left of him . Jackie Milburn (Newcastle, winners 1951) ‘Wor Jackie’ — cousin of Bobby and Jack Charlton — was Newcastle’s top scorer until Alan Shearer broke his record in 2006. He scored both goals in the 2-0 victory over Blackpool in the 1951 final, defended the Cup in 1952 and scored after 45 seconds in the 1955 final win. Milburn later reported on Newcastle for the News of the World and predicted a teenage Paul Gascoigne would become the best player in the world. Former club top goalscorer and Newcastle legend Jackie Milburn (right) in action against Arsenal . Nat Lofthouse (Bolton, runners-up 1953) Lofthouse completed his scoring feat in the ‘Matthews Final’ in which he gave Bolton the lead, only to end up losing 4-3. It was a final attended by Queen Elizabeth II. He did get his hands on the Cup after scoring in the 1958 final, when he barged Manchester United keeper Harry Gregg over the line, later admitting it was a foul. He is Bolton’s record scorer with 285 goals. There is a statue of him outside their stadium. Bolton captain Nat Lofthouse holds the 1958 FA Cup after their win over Man United at Wembley . Charlie Wayman (Preston, runners-up 1954) Wayman worked at Chilton Colliery in County Durham and served in the Royal Navy during World War Two. He was a team-mate of the great Tom Finney in the 1954 final as Preston were beaten 3-2 by West Brom and it was reported that his goal looked suspiciously offside. The pint-sized centre forward was a crowd-pleaser and it was a mystery how he never won England honours. Charlie Wayman (No 9) heads past the Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper in the 1954 FA Cup Semi-final . Jeff Astle (West Brom, winners 1968) Jeff Astle — ‘The King’ as he was known to West Brom fans —scored the only goal in the 1968 victory over Everton, while his strike in a League Cup final defeat by Manchester City two years later saw him become the first player to score in both domestic finals at Wembley. Astle died at 59 and the Justice for Jeff campaign has since been launched calling for an independent inquiry into a link between degenerative brain disease and heading footballs. Baggies fans still applaud during the ninth minute of every match in memory of their great No 9. Jeff Astle of West Brom (second right) jumps for the ball with Arsenal's John Radford and Ian Ure in 1968 . Peter Osgood (Chelsea, winners 1970) Another dubbed ‘The King’ by supporters, Osgood is the last player to score in every round. His goal forced extra-time in the replay versus Leeds, with David Webb netting the winner. Osgood is an icon at Stamford Bridge because of his flair and personality, both on and off the pitch. He died aged 59 following a heart attack at a family funeral. His ashes were buried beneath the penalty spot in front of the Shed End and a statue was later unveiled outside the stadium.

123,"(CNN)You may have heard that Israeli politics is extremely complex. But one of the most important forces at play there is actually rather straightforward: When Israelis feel safe and strong they tend to support moderate parties. When they feel vulnerable they move to the right. Understand that, and you will understand Israel -- and why President Barack Obama may have inadvertently given Benjamin Netanyahu a helping hand. Israelis know they need American support to survive in a hostile, increasingly unstable and radicalized neighborhood, but they don't believe they can trust Obama to help keep them safe. And the president, despite taking numerous measures to support the Jewish state, has done a dismal job of persuading Israelis that he has their back. This reality helps explain how Netanyahu and his rightist Likud party pulled off an upset victory this week, despite opinion polls showing them trailing the main opposition Zionist Union heading into Tuesday's election. Clearly, it's not all Obama's fault. Netanyahu's opponents also failed to address security issues, believing a focus on pocketbook matters would be enough. And Netanyahu is a skilled, articulate and shrewd politician. But Obama, like it or not, was one of the reasons for Likud's success. When Netanyahu traveled to Washington a couple of weeks ago to warn the U.S. Congress about an impending ""bad deal"" with Iran over its nuclear program, Obama refused to meet with him, claiming he didn't want to influence Israel's elections. Few believed this was the real reason -- it's no secret the two men don't particularly like one another. Through much of his presidency, Obama has failed to convince Israelis thay they can trust him. And his handling of the recent spat with Netanyahu only added to the problem. By appearing to dismiss Netanyahu's warning of a ""nuclear nightmare"" over the Iran talks by arguing that the prime minister was offering no ""viable alternatives,"" Obama missed an opportunity to reassure security conscious Israelis that the United States will safeguard their survival. His tacit acknowledgment that there might be no alternative to an imperfect deal was of little comfort to Israelis who have spent years hearing genocidal threats from the Iranian regime. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? The fact that Obama has become one of the key reasons why Netanyahu continues to win elections in Israel is ironic considering Israelis are profoundly worried about the deteriorating ties with the United States, a relationship they consider key to ensuring their country's survival. One recent poll showed only 37% of Israelis believe Obama has a ""positive"" position towards Israel, a mood that has undoubtedly helped Netanyahu enormously, despite the fact that large numbers of former security officials have said Netanyahu is endangering the country by undermining ties with Washington, and despite Israelis saying close relations with the United States are the second most important factor for Israel's security, behind only Israel's own military strength. All this left a genuine opening for Obama to influence the Israeli electorate, because Israelis desperately want to trust the American president -- and they remain America's biggest, most loyal fans, according to a recent Pew poll. 5 questions about Netanyahu's apparent victory . Yet despite the positive sentiment in principle, Israeli voters -- especially on the right -- have been skeptical that Obama has their best interests at heart. This point was underscored in a recent poll that asked Israelis recently if they believed President Obama would agree to a deal that Israeli officials considered harmful to Israel's security. Of those that responded, 61% said yes, he would do so. However, 95% of Labor supporters said no, Obama would do no such thing, while 93% of Likud voters said they believed Obama would disregard Israel's security. The worry over security extends beyond a nuclear deal with Iran to include the other key foreign policy issue -- the possibility of a Palestinian state. A majority of Israelis still support the creation of two states, one for Israelis and another for Palestinians. And despite the last-minute statements from Netanyahu dismissing the idea, it is important to remember that polls have consistently shown Israelis continue to support the establishment of a Palestinian state, as long as Israel's security can be assured. The trouble is that right now, many Israelis don't believe they can preserve their security with a Palestinian state just a few miles from their major cities, not least because previous territorial withdrawals -- from Gaza and from southern Lebanon -- have simply created launch pads for attacks against Israel. So when rightist leaders such as Netanyahu say Israelis will not be safe with a Palestinian state, voters are inclined to believe them. All this suggests that if Obama wants to persuade the Israeli public to push its government towards compromise, he needs to rebuild the public's trust in him. Israelis want peace, but they also need to be reassured that their safety and survival is a paramount concern of their U.S. ally. And if President Obama cannot assure them of this? Well, they will simply wait until there is a president they feel they can trust. It's not that complicated.","Benjamin Netanyahu secured re-election in Israeli election on Tuesday .

124,"As a schoolgirl, Emma Lavelle had twin passions — politics and horses. Had she chosen to pursue the former, spring 2015, with an election looming, could well have proved an important time in her life. But the woman who now runs a 70-box stable in Hampshire is hoping that, having favoured horses over Hansard, the same period definitely turns out to be momentous when she saddles Court By Surprise, her first runner in the £1 million Crabbie's Grand National on April 11. If the 10-year-old wins, Lavelle would be the third female trainer to win Jump racing's best known race this century following Venetia Williams, with Mon Mome in 2009 and Sue Smith, with Auroras Encore in 2013. Emma Lavelle poses with Court By Surprise, her first runner in the £1 million Crabbie's Grand National . And she would also be feted, along with her former jockey husband and assistant Barry Fenton, for executing a long-term precision plan. Court By Surprise has not run since November as Lavelle patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground on which he excels. Lavelle said: 'I did a lot of public speaking and debating at school. Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. Love her or hate her, she was a big presence. I loved her. As a schoolgirl, Lavelle had twin passions — politics and horses - now she is targeting the Grand National . 'She got me interested in politics. I am opinionated and I like talking. I am not so sure now because it is all so grey but at the time I would have been happy to go down that road.' Lavelle's communication skills with owners and staff have been essential after a devastating setback at the start of the season when she lost two of her best horses. Timesremembered, who had finished sixth in the Coral Cup at the 2014 Cheltenham Festival, was killed in his first steeplechase, at Aintree in October, and Le Bec, thought capable of contesting top-quality steeplechases, suffered a serious tendon injury at Ascot a week later. Court By Surprise has not run since November as Lavelle patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground . Lavelle said: 'It really hit us hard. It was like a football team losing their best two players at the start of the season. 'It was hard to pick up and get going again. But you have to keep positive, keep going forward and take your team with you.' Lavelle's season has been rebuilt around Grade Two winner Closing Ceremony, much-improved Parish Business, exciting Bumper winner See The World and, of course, Court By Surprise, who is owned by Kempton chairman Nick Mustoe. Lavelle's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by the late Toby Balding . Court By Surprise ridden by Aidan Coleman clears the last to win the  Best Mate Handicap Steeple Chase . The National entry, who will be ridden at Aintree by Daryl Jacob, won at Exeter in October and was then awarded the Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton after finishing second to fast-improving unqualified entry, The Young Master. Subsequent events tell us Court By Surprise faced handicapping Everest that day. For Saturday week, trainer and horse have that essential Aintree ingredient — a good story to tell. Lavelle's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by working for the late Toby Balding, who won the Aintree race twice. Lavelle, who was first invited to spend a week with Balding aged 11 when he trained a horse for her father, said: 'I was so lucky he let me be so involved. I wasn't strong enough to carry the water bucket in the morning. I filled it and had to get someone to carry it back to the stable. When I look back I found it staggering that, even having ridden ponies, he let me ride racehorses. The National entry, who will be ridden at Aintree by Daryl Jacob, won at Exeter in October . 'He was someone you could learn as much as you wanted to off. If you asked the questions, he would give you the answers. He was a big man who enveloped you in everything.' Court By Surprise, an overpriced 50-1 shot allotted 10st 3lb, has overcome two serious problems — a leg injury when falling on his point-to-point debut and an infected leg which kept him off the course for almost two years and could have ended his career. Lavelle added: 'Having missed the best part of two years, he has not had much racing but maybe it is a blessing in disguise; he is so much stronger. Now, he's the best he's ever been.'","As a schoolgirl, Emma Lavelle had twin passions - politics and horses .

127,"We all have our quirks, but we it comes to snacking Dean Zahariadis takes the perfectly sliced cake. The 31-year-old, from Pyrmont in Sydney, only ever eats his perfectly-portioned snacks with a knife and fork complete with a napkin tucked under his chin to avoid any mess. A self-confessed control freak, it doesn't bother Dean if he gets strange looks for his bizarre snacking rituals which include cutting all his food into bite-size portions and using cutlery for absolutely everything he eats - even the tiniest of items such as nuts and sultanas. Dean is a structured snacker who admits his obsessive behaviour can become quite tiresome and impact on his everyday life. And it seems he's not the only one obsessed with snacking as new statistics show Australians crave snacking more than spending time between the sheets or cuddles with their partners. Dean Zahariadis (right), with his girlfriend Claire Smith (left), must eat all of his food with a knife and fork . Almost two thirds feel the urge to satisfy their stomachs more than their sexual needs with a survey by snack food Wonderful Pistachios revealing that only 49 per cent have the strong desire to be intimate with their loved ones and a mere 39 per cent prefer cuddles over pigging out. Dean, who was diagnosed with a mild case of obsessive compulsive disorder in his first year of university, thinks it's because food is more readily available than sex. But he would still choose being intimate with  girlfriend Claire Smith over his structured snacks. 'I think it might be a case of we just generally crave food more often than intimacy because it's more readily available and we need to more regularly,' he said. Australian Clinical Psychologist and Mind and Body Expert Leanne Hall said  snacking and craving is alluring because it satisfies the pleasure sensors in your brain. 'We tend to use it as a way to make us feel good - whereas intimacy can do the same thing but it depends on the partner doesn't it?' she said. 'Some people say they would rather a block of chocolate over their partner which is a bit concerning.' A manager at Social Brew cafe, Dean must have six saucers perfectly lined up ready to go at at all times . Dean has to cut everything exactly the same size - even if it is for the customers at work . Food is a much quicker and easier craving to fix than the urges that go on in the bedroom. 'Let's face it, the food doesn't expect anything in return does it?' Ms Hall said. 'Whereas snacking just fulfils your need - you don't have to worry about anybody else's needs except your own.' As many as four in five people use snacks as a way to reward themselves or as a form of relaxation, according to a survey of more than 1,000 Australians. Dean admits to feeling very anxious if he can't snack the way he wants to with his particular and precise habits and is only able to relax when everything goes to plan. 'If I've been healthy all week I like to treat myself - very occasionally with a chocolate if I feel like I've accomplished something. 'But my way of indulging is probably different to most because I usually treat myself with a nut bar or muesli bar which still has sugar in it but some might see that as a more healthy option.' However, as much as Dean is controlled with his healthy snacks, his one 'bad habit' is having a can of Coke Zero with dinner every night. 'I find I've become to accustomed to the gas in the soft drink that it actually adds to every meal,' he said. 'If I don't have a bit of the drink left to take that last sip at the end of the meal than I don't feel full - that really drives me insane.' Dean needs all of his food cut up as the same snack size and he always uses a napkin to avoid any mess . Dean admits to becoming exhausted with his fastidious ways especially when at work . The survey results also indicate that Australians are ruled by snacking  behaviour with seven in 10 admitting to eating snacks purely because they are giving into a craving. Dean said his obsessive ways can really impact on his life especially where he works as a manager of the Social Brew cafe in Pyrmont. 'When I’m serving coffee, I line my cups and saucers up like ducks in a row on the counter which has only manifested in the past six months. If anything is out of place, I have to rearrange it immediately,' he said. 'The sweet treat display needs to be immaculately presented and every plate needs to be positioned so it lines up perfectly. 'If I’m going to serve a cake or sandwich to a customer, it needs to be cut into a slice that’s exactly 5cm wide. 'I think that being a perfectionist actually suits my line of work – no one ever complains about having to tidy up after me.' But he does confess to getting tired of doing the same thing '100 times a day'. 'I hate things being moved it drives me insane which can be very exhausting - I'm always thinking ""geez this is so tiring"",' he said. Meanwhile 45 per cent of Australians confess to secretly stashing their favourite treats to hide them from others - and 41 per cent vow they are prepared to travel up to 10km to fulfill their urge for a particular snack. But at the same time, many won't travel too far without their favourite food as 58 per cent  make space for snacks in their suitcases and 48 per cent say they find their trusty treats comforting when away from home. The number one hot spot to feast on your snacks is while you are cosily tucked up bed but not for Dean who can't bear the thought of his bed getting food crumbs on it . As much as Dean is very controlled with his healthy snacks, his one 'bad habit' is having a can of Coke Zero with dinner every night . Dean doesn't like to drive without his portion-sized snacks in the car and avoids flying on planes as much as possible because they make him feel 'woozy'. To prove even further that comfort food is the real deal - the number one hot spot to feast on your snacks is while you are cosily tucked up bed for those who were surveyed. But this is certainly not an ideal snacking scenario for Dean who can't bear the thought of his bed getting dirty. Ms Hall said it is essential to break the habit where you like to snack by turning them into snack-free zones and also creating boundaries where food is only to be consumed in the kitchen or dining room. 'If you usually snack in front of the TV then don't allow food on the couch so you are addressing those triggers that lead to that mindless eating - which is when we overeat because we are usually focusing on a million things at once,' she said. 'If you create those limits then you are less likely to fall in the trap of stashing food in the bedroom or as soon as a movie goes on snacking on popcorn and chips.'","Dean Zahariadis is a structured snacker who always uses a knife and fork .

128,"We are constantly being nagged to floss, with dental experts  claiming it can add years to our life. But according to one dentist, most of us have been doing it incorrectly for years. Dr Carlos Meulener, a  dentist from New Jersey, has released a video showing the best way to floss teeth in order to have the healthiest smile. ‘Brushing is great but it’s not enough - you need flossing to remove the bacteria between the teeth,’ he says. Dr Calos Meulener has released a video showing his 'one minute flossing technique' which he says helps rid the mouth of bacteria. He is pictured holding floss between two thumbs, about an inch apart . He advises taking a piece of wax dental floss and winding it up with the index fingers, but not so tightly that it hurts. When flossing the upper row of teeth, put the thumbs around an inch apart from each other on the floss. Dr Meulener said: ‘The reason why most people have a problem flossing is that they try to get too much floss in their mouths. ‘The way to control it is to use your thumbs for your upper teeth and middle fingers for your lower teeth. ‘Put that amount of floss between these fingers so you can manipulate it easily from one side to the next.’ Then, put the floss between two teeth and floss in and up and down motion along the teeth, rather than a sawing motion from side to side. 1. Take a piece of wax dental floss and put each thumb about and inch apart . 2. Put the floss between the upper teeth . 3. Keeping the back thumb stationary, move the front thumb up and down to floss the tooth . 4. Do not floss in a 'sawing motion' - back and forth - but up and down, rubbing the floss up and down the tooth . 5. Repeat using the middle fingers for the bottom teeth . ‘We’re flossing the walls of one tooth and the other tooth and polishing the bacteria off those surfaces,’ Dr Meulener said. One thumb should stay stationary while the other thumb is moved up and down, creating the flossing motion. Similarly, when flossing the lower teeth, one middle finger should stay stationary while the other is moved, it in order to manipulate the floss so it rubs up and down against the inside of the tooth. Dr Meulener says this method, which takes just a minute, is the best and most efficient way to floss. He said: ‘It takes a minute and it really makes a difference to dental health.’ In the past, studies have shown that flossing teeth can prevent the build up of plaque, which sticks to teeth and causes irritation, inflammation to gums known as gum disease. Gum disease causes bad breath, bleeding gums and, if untreated, cavities, receding gums and tooth loss. Worldwide, 15- 20 per cent of adults aged 35-44 years have severe gum disease, which may result in the loss of teeth. He advises using two thumbs for the upper teeth, or two middle fingers for the lower teeth, and flossing in an 'up and down' motion rather than 'sawing' from side to side . In the UK, the The Adult Dental Health Survey of 2009 found 47 per cent of  the population had moderate to severe gum disease - around 30 million people. Research shows losing teeth could signal a higher risk of suffering heart disease and diabetes. Swedish researchers found people with fewer teeth and bleeding gums were more likely to have a range of cardiovascular problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They found poor dental hygiene and bleeding gums could allow up to 700 different types of bacteria to get into the bloodstream, which increases the risk of a heart attack regardless of how fit and healthy the person is. Previous studies have also linked bad teeth to Alzheimer's, heart disease, strokes, diabetes, lung disease and even miscarriage and premature birth.","Video features Dr Carlos Meulener, a dentist from New Jersey, .

129,"A veterinary student was killed in a murder-suicide just two months before graduation and days before she was expected to attend job interviews. Whitney Engler, 27, was found shot to death in a home she shared with Joseph Hein, 24, in Davis California, on Friday. The body of the University of California student was discovered after police staged a seven-hour stand-off outside the duplex, believing there was an armed gunman inside. Scroll down for video . Veterinary student Whitney Engler, 27, was found shot to death in a home she shared with Joseph Hein, 24, in Davis California, on Friday following a murder-suicide . Police received a mysterious 911 call from a man saying two people had been shot to death inside. According to the Sacramento Bee they initially thought it was a hoax, so only entered the building at 1:30am when they threw tear gas through the window. Authorities have not publicly revealed who pulled the trigger, but Whitney's parents told the California paper officials said her daughter was the victim. She and Hein were said to be in a platonic relationship and in a short-term rental agreement - creating mystery around what prompted the tragic events to unfold. After father, Dennis Engler, told the Bee she moved in with Hein in December because the house she had lived in was too crowded. He said the deal was that she would cook in exchange for five months free rent. Whitney's family have said she and Hein (left) had a platonic relationship. He uploaded a picture to Facebook of a card (left) which read: 'Here lies Joseph Hein, 1991-2015, devoted friend, lover of __________' last year . He also posted images of a black semi-automatic rifle to the social media account . He posted a number of pictures of a semi-automatic rifle on his Facebook last year as well as an image of a card which read: 'Here lies Joseph Hein, 1991-2015, devoted friend, lover of __________.' It had a Cards Against Humanity branding at the bottom, referring to the popular card game. The space is supposed to be filled by a word. Mr Engler said: It’s mystifying. Nothing I’ve learned leads to even a hint of an explanation, which might never be forthcoming. Whitney was a lover of animals and had been looking after a service dog called Rosie at the time. It has since been found after her friends set up a search in the area. Friend and fellow veterinary student Anjolie Anjali Daryani, who led the search for Whitney's pets, said on Facebook on Saturday: 'Last night I lost a good friend, and the world loss an amazing person. Friend Anjolie Anjali Daryani said Whitney was only two months away from graduating and had a number of job interviews planned this weekend . 'Whitney Engler I hope that you rest in peace and know that we are all doing everything we can to find Rosie. 'I will never forget all of our time spent together.. whether it was horseriding, training our dogs, going out to dinners, going shopping, or just hanging out I will miss those moments dearly.' She told Fox 40: 'She had job interviews set up this weekend, she’s less than 2 months away from graduation.' On Saturday night, a vigil was held by Whitney's friends on campus. More than 200 people gathered on the patio of Gladys Valley Hall. Police received a mysterious 911 call on Friday from a man saying two people had been shot to death inside. It prompted a stand-off outside the building which lasted for seven hours .","Whitney Engler, 27, was shot to death at a duplex in Davis, California .

130,"Our ancestors typically rose with the sun and went to sleep when it set, but modern life and artificial lighting has pushed this routine out of sync. However, researchers have discovered a rural community in Brazil that still follows the natural sleep cycles of the past  - despite having access to the same technology as its urban neighbours. And they now plan to study this group to learn more about how our move away from the natural rhythm could be damaging our health. Researchers have discovered a rural community in Brazil that follows the 'natural sleep cycles' (stock image) of our ancestors who rose with the sun, and typically went to bed when it set. The experts now plan to study this group to learn more about how our move away from the natural rhythm could be damaging our health . The community was discovered in the small town of Baependi in south-eastern Brazil in the state of Minais Gerais. Researchers from the University of Surrey and the University of São Paulo studied the population and asked them questions about their sleep habits and patterns. 'In big cities, the availability of cheap electricity has brought us both artificial lighting and a multitude of other electronic devices that compete with us going to sleep at night,' said lead author Dr Malcolm von Schantz from the University of Surrey. 'As a result, most of us go to bed much later than our ancestors did, and, many of us are sleeping less. 'Even though the people in Baependi have access to electricity and television, their daily rhythms are much closer to those of previous generations. 'Studying this population is like being able to look back at past generations through a pair of binoculars and provide an insight into the benefit this natural pattern may be having on their health.' Historian Roger Ekirch of Virginia Tech recently revealed an 'overwhelming amount of historical evidence' that suggested we used to sleep in stages. He found more than 500 references about ancestors sleeping in two shorter periods throughout the night. The total sleep would occur in a 12-hour period that began with up to four hours sleep, an 'awake period' of four hours and then ended with a second four-hour sleep. These days it is widely accepted human sleep patterns are governed by the 'circadian rhythm'. This is the 24-hour cycle of being awake and then, when it becomes dark, resting. 'However, built into this 24-hour pattern is a series of shorter cycles of about 90 minutes - called the ""ultradian rhythm"",' added Dr Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Tired But Wired: How To Overcome Your Sleep Problems. This explains smaller peaks and troughs of energy throughout the day. Dr Ramlakhan believes this ultradian rhythm is a throwback to our hunter-gatherer years. And while we tend to pay much more attention to the 24-hour cycle than the 90-minute one, Dr Ramlakhan believes the body works best when we move with these natural ultradian rhythms, building in pauses, stopping and resting, so continually renewing our energy. The community was discovered in Baependi (marked) in south-eastern Brazil. Residents were asked when they would prefer to wake up and go to bed, and the average answers from the town dwellers were 07.15am and 22.20pm. Whereas people in the countryside preferred to rise at 06.30am and go to bed at 21.20pm . In particular, the residents were asked when they would prefer to wake up and go to bed if they were completely free to plan their day. The average answers from town residents were 07.15 and 22.20, whereas people in the surrounding countryside preferred to rise at 06.30am and go to bed at 21.20. The researchers believe  the difference is due to town residents following much less of a natural sleep/wake cycle because of the influence of artificial lighting. 'When we asked the same question in London, the average answers were 08.30am and 23.15pm,' continued Dr von Schantz. The paper explained that people in Baependi maintain a stronger link with the so-called solar rhythm because they predominantly work outdoors. They therefore have similar patterns as pre-industrial ancestors.  Town residents follow less of a natural sleep/wake cycle because of the influence of artificial lighting (stock image) The paper explained that the people of Baependi, especially those in the countryside, maintain a much stronger link with the so-called solar rhythm. This is because they predominantly work outdoors and therefore have similar patterns as our pre-industrial ancestors. Solar time uses the mid-points of the light and dark 'periods' - notably midnight and noon - as timing references. In circadian rhythms, sunrise start this clock on its 24-hour run, but this continues regardless of a shift in when the sun sets meaning the mid-points vary. 'Midnight really represents the middle of the dark phase, and yet many of us in the industrialised world are not even in bed by then,' continued Dr von Schantz. 'Our colleagues at the University of São Paulo have studied this population, so there is a lot of data emerging about the health outcomes of the same population. 'We are optimistic that this project will teach us to what extent cardiovascular health, obesity, diabetes, and mental health problems may be associated with our move away from the natural day/night cycle, and the associated sleep loss.'","Study has found a Brazilian community with 'pre-industrial' sleeping habits .

131,"A writer and mother has candidly revealed that she was left emotionally 'scarred' by her agonizing drug-free childbirth and struggling with a condition known as postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder following the delivery of her daughter. Toronto-based mother-of-one Tara-Michelle Ziniuk recalled how the traumatizing birth of her now four-year-old daughter Anna left her with nightmares and vivid memories of her painful experience in an essay for Today's Parent. 'At the time, in that moment, I remember very clearly thinking I wanted it to stop more than I wanted to have my baby,' she wrote. 'It was horrible. I was exhausted and borderline suicidal.' Traumatic event: Tara-Michelle Ziniuk (not pictured) said she was left with nightmares following the painful, drug-free birth of her daughter Anna, who is now four-years-old . Miss Ziniuk explained that by the time she asked for something to help with the pain she was 'too far along for it to be administered.' The mom, who suffered from painful cramping almost her entire life because of her endometriosis, said she dreaded the idea of giving birth before she had even gotten pregnant, noting that although she wanted to 'experience pregnancy', she never wanted to 'experience childbirth'. When it was time for her baby to be welcomed into the world, Miss Ziniuk passed on having an epidural because the prenatal class she had attended was 'biased towards natural home births'. According to Postpartum Support International, symptoms of postpartum PTSD may include: . Intrusive recollection of a past traumatic event, including child birth . Flashbacks or nightmares . Avoidance of stimuli associated with the event, including thoughts, feelings, people, places and details of the event . Persistent increased arousal, including irritability, difficulty sleeping, hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response . Anxiety and panic attacks . Feeling a sense of unreality and detachment . Miss Ziniuk, who is currently co-parenting her daughter, was a single mother at the time of her pregnancy. She said she was given information that made her 'fear epidurals, pain medications and any other “unnecessary” interventions""', although she noted that there was no 'shame associated' if the interventions were needed for medical reasons. 'The contractions felt like an extreme version of the menstrual cramps I’d experienced with endometriosis,' she recalled. 'It also felt similar to chronic illness in that I felt like I had no control over what was happening - a familiar, yet difficult, experience for me.' Miss Ziniuk wrote that she 'disassociated' and wanted her personal support system and her midwife to leave her alone because she 'didn't want to talk to anyone'. Tara-Michelle (pictured) said she hated giving birth . 'I felt disgusting and embarrassed and sick; nothing was comfortable or bearable. I wanted it to stop,' she recalled. Although Miss Ziniuk said that her daughter's birth was 'not complicated', it was a 'long early labor'. Her water never broke, and her daughter even came out with a scratch on her head from the doctor trying to break her water for her. After her experience in the delivery room, Miss Ziniuk started having nightmares and was unable to talk about her experience when others asked about her birthing experience. She was eventually diagnosed as having PTSD - the same condition that plagues soldiers who have engaged in war-time battles. According to Postpartum Support International, one to six percent of women experience postpartum PTSD, an illness that can be caused by a real or perceived trauma during delivery or after childbirth. While Postpartum PTSD greatly differs from postpartum depression, which is a form of depression that results from the hormonal changes that occur in a woman's body, they can occur at the same time in certain cases. But both conditions are temporary and can be treated with professional help. Although Miss Ziniuk explained she struggles with recommending drug-free childbirth, she knows that her terrible experience was specific to her particular situation. She ended her essay by saying: 'My wish that I was unable to recall my daughter’s birth does not negate the good that came from becoming her mother - but my experience of parenthood to date has had nothing to do with my so-called natural childbirth.","Tara-Michelle Ziniuk, from Toronto, Canada, recalled how the birth of her four-year-old daughter Anna left her with nightmares .

134,"The Greek foreign minister has claimed that his country deserves EU help because it has not committed crimes on the scale of the Holocaust – while Germany has confirmed that it will not pay Greece war reparations. Angela Merkel met far-Left Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Berlin yesterday – his first visit to Germany since he came to power in January. Mr Tsipras is understood to have told the German Chancellor that Greece would face insolvency within weeks without the release of more funds. Angela Merkel (right) meeting with far-Left Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras (left) in Berlin was overshadowed by comments from the Greek foreign minister, whoc claimed that his country deserves EU help because it has not committed crimes on the scale of the Holocaust .

The Greek government is claiming Germany must now repay a loan which was ‘forced’ on Athens in 1942. Pictured: Merkel and Tsipras listen to their countries' national anthems upon his arrival for talks . However the meeting was overshadowed by comments from Nikos Kotzias, the Greek foreign minister, who said in an interview that his country deserved to be treated as leniently as post-war Germany. He suggested that Germany should help set up a commission to come up with a plan to compensate Greece for the suffering caused by the Nazis during the Second World War. The Greek government is claiming that Germany must now repay a loan which was ‘forced’ on Athens in 1942, as well as pay for Nazi atrocities. And speaking to a German newspaper yesterday, Mr Kotzias pointed out that Germany had not been made to make arduous repayments after the war. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (right) receiving Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias (left) at the Foreign Office in Berlin. Kotzias risked further inflaming tensions by referring to the Holocaust to back demands to be treated as leniently as post-war Germany . German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomes Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras as he arrives at the chancellery in Berlin. He told Suddeutsche Zeitung: ‘The Allies were very generous with Germany; they did not smother Germany. ‘There was an interest to build Germany up again. Don’t we have the same rights?’ He went on to ask if the ‘crimes that our people committed’ were greater than ‘Dachau or Auschwitz’ – referring to two of the most notorious Nazi concentration camps where more than a million people were murdered. At the press conference yesterday, Mr Tsipras also renewed the demand for war reparations, saying: ‘We must work on the issue of forced loans and Second World War reparations.’ However Mrs Merkel said she viewed the demands as an attempt to distract from the need for economic reforms, adding: ‘The issue of war reparations is closed from a political and legal point of view. The topic has no relationship with the crisis and its emergencies.’ Tsipras is expected to present a list of reforms, hoping to unlock bailout funds to prevent Greece from running out of cash next month, Greek government sources said . The Greek government has insisted that Germany must repay a loan forced on occupied Athens in 1942 and make reparations for Nazi atrocities . European leaders are currently refusing to give Greece any more money unless the Left-wing government commits to reforms. If they fail to come to an arrangement then Greece will be forced to leave the euro – plunging the continent into financial crisis. Yesterday Mrs Merkel was careful to point out that Germany was only one of the eurozone nations that would be responsible for deciding whether Greece’s reforms are sufficient, and said that no decisions had been made in her talks with Mr Tsipras. But she remained positive, saying the meeting had been held in ‘a spirit of trust’. The Greek prime minister also characterised the talks as ‘positive’, saying he found Mrs Merkel ‘listens and wants to be constructive’. He said the Chancellor had invited him to come to Berlin over the phone, telling him: ‘It is better to talk with one another than about one another.’ Mr Tsipras went on to say: ‘I did not come here for financial help. I came for an exchange of our thoughts.’ Yesterday the Eurasia risk consultancy group said the likelihood of Greece having to leave the euro had risen from 20 to 30 per cent. The group’s eurozone analyst Mujtaba Rahman said: ‘The prospects of a deal are diminishing, as Germany, the eurogroup and Greece continue to posture. While Berlin still wants to keep Greece in the eurozone, it will not be flexible regarding the conditions attached to more financial aid.’ Greek foreign minister Nikos Kotzias risked further inflaming tensions by referring to the Holocaust to back demands to be treated as leniently as post-war Germany . Tsipras' visit comes after Merkel and other European leaders last week told him to come up soon with budget cuts and tax increases that would enable him to get urgently needed bailout money .","Greek government has insisted that Germany must repay a loan forced on occupied Athens in 1942 and make reparations for Nazi atrocities .
